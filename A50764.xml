            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>An Introduction to Chemick Philoſophy and Phyſick.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow hard and high a point it is to handle (what ſhall I ſay? to unfold and ſhew naked to the ſight) the Living and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Philoſophy, it is hence manifeſt, that (as far as I know) it hath not by any man been undertaken. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Philoſophers and wiſe Old-men have involved and enwrapped the myſteries of Secrets and Vital Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy in ſhadowed Sentences; and they delivered it over upon the ſame condition that they received it: as we may ſee in the Epiſtle of <hi>Plato</hi> which he writ to <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius,</hi> in which we read it thus written; <hi>You ſay that Nature is not ſufficiently demonſtrated and explained unto you, which is the chief thing; therefore it is to be entreated upon, but yet by aenigms and obſcure ſentences; ſo that if any ſhall happen to the table by Sea or Land, which ſhall read theſe but not underſtand them, what ſhall they do but reſt amazed the five years ſilence of</hi> Pythagoras? What did <hi>Sphinx</hi> among the Egyptians but contend that Aenigms and Myſteries were to be taught and promulged in a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical ſenſe? Concerning the more profound Philoſophers and Phyſicians, which have uſed a more divine original
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30788:14"/>
of their Art; as alſo Phyſicians, which have uſed a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proceeding in their Cures; they alſo have handled the Principles and Grounds of the Art, and left Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries full of riddles and obſcurities.</p>
               <p>Thus from the forenamed Philoſophers and others it is evident, that the way of approching unto the provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Vital Philoſophy hath not been manifeſt. For the Inſtructors and Maſters gave precepts of Philoſophy un<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>to their Scholars, which were obliged unto them by their faith and perpetual gratitude, and ſuch as were ſworn unto them; which preceps are as yet to be illuſtrated and expounded with much diligence. Furthermore, the Scholars gave their oaths that they would imitate the ſteps of the precepts of their fathers, and that they would not prophane nor deflower the virginity of Nature by temerity or raſhneſs, which hath been kept from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world.</p>
               <p>For the excellency and utility of this Philoſophy, it is ſo great that none can open and unlock the doors of Nature which are ſhut and lockt, much leſs can he enter into the inmoſt cloſets of Nature, which knoweth not and throughly ſeeth the nature of this undefiled Virgin. What can Philoſophers perform, or what can Phyſicians, or what can Chemiſts, unleſs they kiſs this Virgin with a ſweet kiſs?</p>
               <p>This Virgin might have come forth into the conſpect of her Lover more trim and deckt, but ſhe (like unto a chaſte Virgin which abhorreth frizling and painting) had rather offer her ſelf untrimmed at the firſt, by ſo diligent negligence, hoping that though ſhe were ſeen bare and naked, yet ſhe might provoke wonderful love.</p>

                  <p>IN that I am about to unfold and explain the ſacred and ancient Philoſophy, which is collected forth of the Philoſophy of the Academicks and Peripateticks, I have thought it meet to ſet before your eyes the Opinions of the ancient Philoſophers concerning the nature of things, and that in brief to repeat that whereby it may appear now far Vital Philoſophy hath excelled and ſurpaſſed the rude and corpulent Philoſophy. Which things being underſtood and throughly viewed, it will be convenient to deſcend to the fountains of things. All the precepts of ancient Philoſophers which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the knowledge of Natural things, have been hidden and concealed of them under feigned and dark ſhadows and fables: for all thoſe things which divine <hi>Plato,</hi> and after him <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> have writ concerning the World and nature of things; as alſo whatſoever <hi>Empedocles</hi> or <hi>Parmenides,</hi> or <hi>Pythagoras</hi> have brought into the light, all thoſe precepts have been the precepts of thoſe which writ ancient fables; from whoſe precepts every one hath ſo much profited, as he could attain unto by the faculty of his Wit.</p>
                  <p>Their precepts did ſignifie that the World was created of God, and that it conſiſts of one univerſal and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon matter. Wherefore they held there was but one World, and not many; and that Time was cauſed from the motion of the Heaven; and that the Heavens, while they were moved, did effect a muſical harmony by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the magnitude of their bodies; and that the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Matter of the Heaven exiſted, and that the Elements
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30788:15"/>
were obnoxious to corruption and tranſmutations, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their parts. Whenas yet the whole ſubſtance is ſo created of him, that it might be eternal. All theſe are conſerved from corruption by the Soul of the World or Divine power.</p>
                  <p>They al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o did expreſs by fables that the Earth was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, and that all other things were moved with perpetual motions, and that the parts of the Elements mutually amongſt themſelves were generated and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the heat and cold of the Heaven, and that there were made more frequent mutations of all theſe about the Earth. They alſo did lay open by fables the generation of Hail, Rain and Thunder, and other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors, which are cauſed by the Sun from Vapours eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upwards. And alſo they expreſſed how Living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Plants were generated by the commixtion and corruption of the Elements; of all which the Sun is the efficient cauſe by his moderate heat. Again, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that all the living bodies ſhould die which were compoſed of many principles or beginnings, becauſe every compounded body is at length to be reſolved into his principles.</p>
                  <p>Now at length we come to explain the nature of Plants and Fruits.</p>
                  <p>They in their fables declared that the ſeaſons of Time were profitable to them when the Fruits and Plants are fit to gather ſtrength and yield fruit.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the generation of all things, whether it be by corruption of life, or conjunction of Male and Female, it is governed and holpen by the temperature of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, both in procreating and conſerving, or bringing them up: for from that temperature there ariſes an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and deſire of procreating.</p>
                  <p>Again, they have entreated of the Changes and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Moon whoſe humour is expedient in the Full
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30788:15"/>
Moon to thoſe that bring forth, and for the increaſe of Plants, and the conſervation of living things which are bred. And they ſaid that the principal author of this power was the Sun; which therefore the Phyſicians thought to be a skilful governour of Health and Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: for ſeeing the mediocrity and temperature, and the grievouſneſs and magnitude of the Heat is cauſed by it, this power is not undeſervedly attributed to the Sun. They judged the Sun to be the miniſtrant cauſe of God, by which all things are made and generated; ſeeing that he by this mixeth the Elements, from whoſe commixti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons all things are generated.</p>
                  <p>This was their Philoſophy, which is no other viſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained than in the ſenſe of Fables.</p>

But becauſe that all Knowledge proceeds from the Cauſes, and then we are ſaid to know a thing whenas we know it from the fountain of Cauſes, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> writes perſpicuouſly in the 2. chap. <hi>Analyticor. po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterior.</hi> where he defines that to Know abſolutely is to Know by the Cauſes, by which every thing hath being.

No man ſhall be able to ſteal away the golden Apples of the three daughters of <hi>Atlas</hi> in the Garden of <hi>Tantalus,</hi> whiles the Dragon watches, but when he ſleepeth. Wherefore ſeeing the knowledge of the Cauſes is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the firſt place, the univerſal internal principle or Beginning offers the conſideration of it unto us; whoſe contemplation being neglected and not throughly ſeen into, many and great Philoſophers have caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves head long into divers labyrinths of Sophiſms; but aſſuredly he which will beſtow his ſtudy in Phileſophy, muſt aim at the real Being, as one which ſaileth and aimeth at the pole-ſtar; and he muſt never ſuffer it to

                  <p>The Interiour and Eſſential Form is a Vital Principle or Beginning, containing in it all the Cauſes of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per kind, by which it frameth the Body for it ſelf; and it doth (as it were) forth of her boſom draw forth Colours, Taſters, Qualities, Magnitude, Figures, and other ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures which are convenient and agreeable for their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and purpoſes.

So they explain the firſt Subject, though all mix'd bodies ariſe from the Elements, notwith landing all theſe Elements have ſo nething preexiſtent, namely the Firſt Matter, for which and by which they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to manifold tranſmutations. And whenas the Form of the body vaniſheth away, and is corrupted, notwith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>anding the Eſſence of it remaineth the ſame, forthwith receiving another form. Furthermore, they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30788:17"/>
call the Firſt Matter the firſt ſubject of Generation; therefore they conclude that things muſt return and be reſolved at the laſt into the ſame matter. But this is not to be underſtood that they muſt be reſolved immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into it, but that every Corruption muſt neceſſarily at length be terminated in the Firſt Matter. How ſtrange theſe be from the Firſt Matter of the Philoſophers, it ſhall be manifeſt if that we recall the things forenamed unto our due conſideration.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Peripateticks</hi> have ſignified nothing elſe by theſe Arguments than a rude principle and vile maſs, from which the Elements were created; which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">

In like manner they affirmed that the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or corruption of one Form was the cauſe of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of another Form in the matter by the virtue of Privation. But our Firſt Matter doth bring forms to all natural things, and it ſuſtains them, not materially, but effectively and formally. There doth not any deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or corruption happen unto our Firſt Matte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

From hence it appeareth that they leſt the true Firſt Matter of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers unſearcht and untoucht, which the Creator infuſed into that firſt Maſs, (by his incomprehenſible wiſdom and wonderful Decree) by the power of the Word and his Spi i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> which moved upon the waters; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this Matter is not ſubject unto the judgment of ſenſe and common notions of the mind, it is inviſible and naked, and doth not enter into the company of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal men; but it hath veſtures (the princi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ples of Bodies and the Elements) by which it keeps it ſelf from the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30788:18"/>
ſight of impious and ſottiſh men. Theſe veſtures of the Elements have bewitched the eyes of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> and many other Philoſophers; for they ſuppoſed that they apprehended the interiour and eſſential form of the Creature, and as it were held the kernel in their hands, whenas they attained but unto the barks, husks, and foul nature of the ſuperficial Elements.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs inviſible things may be made viſible, whenas their veſtures be put off, and hid things may be made manifeſt. This Matter is naked <hi>Diana</hi> without any veſture, which doth not eaſily ſhew it ſelf, or put off the garments with which it is covered of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be put off by the ſubtile and skilful art of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations. That Firſt true Matter of the Philoſophers, though inviſible and ſpiritual, yet it abides and remains with us, and it is very often preſented to the ſenſe of the Wiſe by the help and benefit of the bonds and nigh bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies (that is, the beginnings) from which it cannot be ſeparated, but by theſe and in theſe it exerciſes the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. But the veſtures may be put off; theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (that is, the Elements) may be ſeparated from their beginnings. Divine <hi>Plato</hi> purſued this Firſt Matter by a certain excellent motion of the mind, and he entitled it by the name of an <hi>Idea</hi> in his <hi>Timeus,</hi> where we read it thus written; <hi>It is meet that we confeſs that this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is spiritual, which is the ſame ſtill without beginning:</hi> that is, which is compounded of no preexiſtent matter; and it is without corruption, that is, which is reſolved into no other matter, which receives nothing from others, neither doth it proceed to another, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perceived by Sight or any other ſenſe, though Underſtanding doth apprehend it as it were by accident. There is another Matter of the ſame name, and like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, but yet it may be perceived by ſenſe; and it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, and it is ever in motion; as alſo it is in place:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30788:18"/>
whereupon afterwards it doth as it were vaniſh. This is comprehenſible by opinion and ſenſe. In like manner <hi>Plato</hi> did affirm univerſal <hi>Ideae</hi> or Notions, and an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal beginning, from which new forms might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, though the forms of all do periſh.</p>
                  <p>But here ſome may object, wherefore we do attribute the force of an efficient and a formal cauſe to the ſame thing; for whatſoever hath the force of an efficient cauſe, hath not the force of a formal as an immanent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. We anſwer, that though the notion of an effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe be attributed to the Firſt Matter as an interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our form, yet ſometimes the form receiveth the notion of an efficient cauſe, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> witneſſeth <hi>Acroaſi Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica,</hi> where he ſaith, that the form is the efficient cauſe of the natural operations and actions. But if ſome ſhall as yet gain-ſay and urge the argument more, we will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this, that we place the cauſes in the Firſt Matter, and not the Firſt Matter in the cauſes. It is more meet to apply the names to the things, than the things to the names. Even as mechanical Artiſts have certain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Rules which they do not uſe but altogether ſtraight, but ſometimes they uſe thoſe which are ſomewhat crookt, by reaſon of the matter of which they are about to frame material workmanſhip, often they are conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to uſe a Rule ſomewhat crookt; of which figure was the Rule of <hi>Lesbia</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> relates in the 10. chap. of his <hi>Ethicks,</hi> which Rule was made of Lead, that it might be bended according to the figure or ſhape of the ſtones. So that ſtill it is not convenient to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the Matter to the Rule, but ſometimes the Rule to the Matter, as <hi>Zabarella</hi> affirms. After the ſame manner we muſt make a treatiſe of the Matter in a more ſound Philoſophy, by reaſon of the ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, preeminence, and majeſty of the ſame; that it may appear clearly (as it were at mid-day) we will examine
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30788:19"/>
what difference is betwixt the Firſt Matter of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and the <hi>Peripateticks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Peripateticks</hi> affirm that the Firſt Matter was formleſs, and had an aptitude to receive any form of a natural body.</p>
                  <p>But the more ſecret Philoſophers, which have peirced into the inmoſt cloſet of Nature, they confeſs that the Firſt Matter contains all forms in it, and that all forms of all natural bodies are deduced forth of the boſom of it as forth of a rich ſtore-houſe; and that it communicates life to all lifeleſs things, and actions, and faculties. Therefore ſeeing the caſe ſtands thus, it is not pertinent to the Firſt Matter to receive forms, which needs none, for it poſſeſſeth the actions; but rather it belongs to the Elements, which are in the place of the Second matter. This the Philoſophers call the Secundary Cauſe, becauſe it is requiſite for the form; as for the end they call it the Cauſe, <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> becauſe without it nothing can be made. The Philoſophers call it a being in power, in the doctrine of the cauſes or principles; becauſe that afterwards it is diduced and brought to perfection and act by the agent. But our Firſt Matter and interiour form doth inform, perfect and determine this matter or ſecundary cauſe; whereupon it is called the Informing Act, and Perfection. This form doth conſtitute and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Second Matter in a certain proper degree of being, ſo that it gives unto it eſſence and actual exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence. From hence it is called the Conſtitutive and Specifical Eſſence, for it ſeparates and diſtinguiſhes one thing from another primarily and eſſentially; hereupon it is called the Difference. But that I may contract the ſails, for I will diſpatch in few words. The <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> call the Firſt Matter a mere paſſive principle or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and they annex a reaſon, becauſe it ſuffereth and ſubjecteth it ſelf to be prepared and informed, no
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30788:19"/>
otherwiſe than if Wax ſhould be informed and figured, ſometime with the ſhape of a Dog, ſometime of a Lion. Which deſcription agreeth to the ſimple, common and abſolute Elements, and not unto the Firſt Matter of the Philoſophers, ſeeing that our Firſt Matter reſpecteth the Compound actively, and not paſſively.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the reaſons being collected and alleged,<note place="margin">The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are veſtiments of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the Principles are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiments of the Firſt Matter or Form.</note> we affirm that the Firſt Matter of the Philoſophers is the interiour form, the beginning of life, the fountain of motion and actions, the author of fruitfulneſs, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of generations, tranſplantations, and of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural actions, by whoſe means and benefit the repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and contrary Elements are united by the concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant law of Mixtion. Again, the ſaid Elements being corrupted and deſtroyed at the finiſhed times, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs there remaineth in this Matter the beginning of life, the root and form of the thing, in ſuch power that it excelleth the common qualities of the Elements.</p>

                  <p>THoſe which are little converſant in Philoſophy, and cannot as yet apprehend the unaccuſtomed manner of ſpeaking of the Philoſophers, they altogether contend about the Name; if that the name of the thing be ſuppreſſed, forthwith they ſuppoſe that the thing it ſelf is quite overthrown. For the removing of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, all thoſe are to be inferred which make ſomething for the perſpicuity and facility of the excellent and noble thing. Amongſt the reſt firſt of all In-bred and Native Heat offers it ſelf unto our conſideration, as alſo Spirits, and firſt-begot Humidity, and Nature, which are of a more lofty conſideration. It is a conſtant and ratified ſentence amongſt the Philoſophers, <hi>that all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30788:20"/>
things live becauſe of the heat included in it:</hi> and by the benefit of it they attract aliment and do perfect it, and therewith are nouriſhed and augmented, and do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create their like. Furthermore, living creatures by the benefit of this heat are affected with ſenſe and motion; and by how much theſe works or creatures are more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, by ſo much they have a more abundant force and ſubſtance of this heat. The living bodies of this inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Globe are divided into three orders, Animals, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, and Minerals; though many have denied life to be in any Mineral, notwithſtanding they have ſhewn manifeſt ſigns of life unto thoſe which have more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſearched their work-houſes or mines. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath truly delivered that life is contained by heat, and that neither Animals nor Plants could live without heat. Again, he defining Death he oppoſed not cold as a contrary to heat, but extinction, which is a privation of heat. To which alſo <hi>Hippocrates</hi> aſcribeth all the actions of the whole Animals: he alſo affirmed that all and moſt diverſe faculties are abſolved and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the benefit of this heat at fit ſeaſons and places.</p>
                  <p>Philoſophers ſearching the nature of this heat, they have fallen into ſtrange errours in that they did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the ethereal and celeſtial heat from the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary heat which is in all things, riſing from the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and temperature of the Elements; but this is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and void, or a companion or adjunct-embaſſadour of the thing compound. But the natural or vital heat is altogether alienated from the conditions of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; whereupon they called it Celeſtial and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Divine. Again, any man may eaſily diſtinguiſh and diſcern the vital heat from the elementary heat in Plants and cold animals, as in the Poppy, the Lettuce, the Mandrake, and the Serpent, which being exceeding
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30788:20"/>
cold in their temperature, it is certain that they do not live by this, but by ſole vital ſpirits and heat. Again, they brought it into controverſie whether heat, which is the worker of life, be a ſubſtance or an accident. Laſtly, after much contention of words they concluded it to be an accident, but yet altogether celeſtial and divine, as the light or the heat of the Sun is, and every other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or power conveyed from the Heavens unto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared body. They alſo affirm, that that nature or form which conſiſts in the matter, by the mediation of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or heat to be altogether one ſubſtance, and that wholly celeſtial and divine, not participating at all of the Elements. The later is beaten upon and vulgar amongſt the more ſecret Philoſophers, but they have not received the firſt. But becauſe Philoſophers do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of vital heat, they do not conſider it as an accident, but they comprehend together the in-bred ſpirits and the radical matter; that is, the native humidity in which the heat is ſeated, under the name and appellation of heat; for truly every thing may be found forth by it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe of this errour is becauſe they have not known the original of forms; which thing we wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate and explain more amply and copiouſly in the Chapter <hi>Of the original and differences of Forms.</hi> The<note place="margin">The divers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> names of Vital Heat.</note> more profound Philoſophers have called this Vital Heat the Internal Sun, the Internal Element, and the Mineral Sun, in which all the grounds of Nature are contained. <hi>Arnoldus de Villa nova,</hi> in his book of Conſerving youth and deferring old age, the third chap. he conſirmeth it in expreſs words, ſaying, <hi>That which hath not an equal, is the Mineral Sun.</hi> And wiſe men have compared the prepared body to the natural heat and ſound youth; for which ſimilitude the wiſe men have uſed to call this heat by the name of an Animal; for vital Sulphur and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30788:21"/>
radical humidity is the ſtore-houſe of all Nature, for by the onely power of it all the cures of all diſeaſes may be accompliſhed. <hi>Galen</hi> being adduced by the notable and wonderful power of the actions, in the ſecond book of his Art unto <hi>Glauco,</hi> he calleth the native Heat the Subſtance of the faculties and vertues; which thing he doubted much in another place concerning the ſubſtance of Nature and the Soul. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the ſecond book of the Generations of Animals, the third chap. aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth all the faculties of all natural things to this vital heat in theſe words, <hi>There is ſomething in the ſenſe of all things which cauſes the ſeed to be fruitful;</hi> namely that which is called vital heat; not fire, for it is not any ſuch faculty, but the ſpirit which is contained in the ſeed or foamy body, and the nature which is in that ſpirit in proportion is correſpondent to the element of Stars. <hi>Plato,</hi> which came nigher to the ſhut gates of Nature, called this heat or ſpirit the Defence of the form; which heat is incident in Animals and Plants from the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. He alſo writes, that from this univerſal ſpirit of the World, which alone conſociates and conjoyns the ſoul to the World, and contains the virtues, that it was thereby cauſed and conſerved; for it comprehends the<note place="margin">The Seed of every thing, and the power of Procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> ſeminal reaſons and hidden proprieties of all Procreants; it filleth all, and it is diffuſed through all, and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated into all Animals, Plants and Metalls; and theſe as it were of the green wind of Sulphur.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the native or firſt-begor Humidity, there<note place="margin">Firſt-begot Humidity.</note> is required an accurate diſtinction of the Humours in every natural body, for the attaining of the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof; ſeeing that there is one humour Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, another Alimentary, another Native or firſt-begot; and that there is much difference of them. For the Elementary and Alimentary humidity do differ much from the Native and firſt begot humidity in the ſubſtance,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30788:21"/>
eſſence and nature. The Elementary humidity is a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh humour, by which (as it were with glew) the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentient and repugnant Earthly parts of the body do co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here and are united; and this is common to all things which are generated by the commixtion of the concrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Elements.</p>

Afterwards the Planet cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth<note place="margin">Every nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition or nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſpiritual, or it is made by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. From hence is the dewiſh moiſtening of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſm.</note> and forſaketh the compound, as the Philoſophers affirm; in theſe the Spirit ought neither to ſerve for ſence or motion.</p>
                  <p>The Native or Inbred moiſture (which is alſo called the Vital moiſture) is called of the Philoſophers the quinteſſence which may be extracted from all living roots. There inhereth a matter repreſenting Oil, which is the ſubject of Heat and Spirits; it is alſo indiſſolvable, from which natural ſpirits and vital heat floweth as forth of a ſeminary, and perfuſeth the whole living body, from which alſo the ſtrength and firmneſs of the parts ariſe.</p>
                  <p>This fat humour which is very like Oil, is not fat with<note place="margin">Of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſm.</note> which we ſee many parts of the body covered; but it is other fat very much different and aery, which flyeth the ſight of the eye, nevertheleſs it may be diſtinguiſhed by art and induſtry; and this is the Original both of ſpirits, and inbred and Native heat. It is alſo the firſt ſubſtance, which they call the Firſt-begotten moiſture, for it is the firſt, and common to all living things in which the ſpirit perfuſed with heat primarily and by it ſelf conſiſts, ſo that neither of them can endure long without the help
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30788:22"/>
and vertue of this humour: for there is ſuch an agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſpiring harmony and continual affinity amongſt them; ſo that they work mutually, neither can any of them effect any thing being deſtitute and deprived of the help of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The Radical matter is as it were the Original and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the Heat, for the heat is ſuſtained by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it. This Heat is as the principal efficient cauſe, the Humidity is ſubjected to the heat in the place of the matter, and ſuffereth more, from which we may at the firſt behold as it were in a glaſs, that the Native heat is the Radical moiſture perfuſed every where with inbred ſpirits and heat.</p>
                  <p>And this is the whole ſubſtance of the ſounder <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> (as they call them) of the which we have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſpoke. Now it followeth that we handle of Nature.</p>

                     <hi>PLutarch</hi> a grave and learned man ſaith, that the knowledge of truth is ſo amiable and delectable, that our very being and act of living was given unto us for the knowledge of the truth. Seeing therefore that it is elſewhere firm and ſtable, but eſpecially in Philoſophy it is judged to be ratified, firm, conſtant and ſtable; therefore (I ſay) it is to be weighed more deeply in our judgments, leſt that we be thought only to follow the ſhadow of Nature, the image of light being left behind our backs: and alſo leſt that the inquiſition of truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſthibited, we do fall into errours which cannot be avoided, and ſo make our ſelves unwotthy of our life and office. Certainly if we conſider <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, and the difference of the Nature of things, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30788:22"/>

Firſt, we will bring the definition of Nature into light, that it may throughly be underſtood of us.</p>
                  <p>Nature is the beginning of motion and of reſt, in that<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the ſecond Book of Phyſical au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcultations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The Nature of every thing is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, by which all things are that they are, and do that they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do.

The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and eſſence of Nature is inbred heat.</note> thing in which it is primarily and by it ſelf, and not by accident.</p>
                  <p>What doth he mean by this definition of Nature? for it makes nothing for the knowledge of the very ſubſtance of Nature. For though thou ſay unto me that Nature is the beginning of motion, or that which moveth all things: nevertheleſs it remaineth as yet unexplained and defined what the ſubſtance of Nature, and what the eſſence of the Movent is, from whence all actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed which are comprehended under Motion. But theſe are the ſubtilties of the Peripateticks, by which they bring counterfeits unto others: but let us let them paſs leſt we be thought to contend with ſhades and ghoſts; and let us convert our ſpeech to thoſe which have ſearched forth the very eſſence of Nature, and have contemplated the very truth thereof, and have as it were handled it in their hands, and ſeen it with their eyes; with whom we profeſs that the ſubſtance and eſſence of Nature is Native and Inbred heat, which before we have deſcribed. It hath conformed and augmented Animals, Vegetables and Minerals from the beginning, and as it were nouriſh the cauſe of all natural effects. Therefore Nature, as likewiſe inbred heat comprehends three things, namely Radical moiſture, Spirits, and Heat. All theſe ate generated of one ſeed, and at one genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is that Nature in which the ſeminary cauſes of things are ſecretly contained. In which the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of the <hi>Platonicks</hi> triumphs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:30788:23"/>
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> and their Sectators which writ the precepts of Natural Philoſophy, doubted not that there was a certain Nature with us, and that well known, and that which all conclude to be the vulgar principle of Philoſophy, which neither ought nor can be demonſtrated, which only we comprehend in mind and underſtanding. <hi>Galen</hi> brings <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to confirm this in the ninth Book of the Opinions of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Plato. Hippocrates</hi> durſt not affirm what the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Nature is in the conforming and governing of us, and that it was the workman and cauſe of us. But <hi>Galen</hi> durſt in his Book of Diet, where he ſaith, that Fire<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands by the name of Fire, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf.</note> can move all things generally, and that Water can nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh all things, and that theſe two things are ſufficient for all things and for themſelves; but neither of them ſeparately is ſufficient for it ſelf or others; in which words he manifeſtly declares the eſſence of Nature and the ſubſtance thereof; in that he ſignified Nature by the name of Fire, which moveth all things univerſally; He calleth the eſſence and ſubſtance of Nature Water, which nouriſheth all things wholly: for it is received from the more profound Philoſophers, that all natural bodies are nouriſhed by this natural Balſam, though not pure but mixed with diverſe impurities; ſo all nutriments are ſpiritual and humid after the ſimilitude of ſeeds, which in the beginnings of generations muſt be ſpiritual and humid. But he expreſſeth his mind more plainly by much in theſe words, Theſe two are ſufficient both for all others and for themſelves, but ſeparately they are neither ſufficient for themſelves or others. What mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth he almoſt by this divine Oracle? but that theſe two Fire and Water, that is, Nature and Eſſence to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute all natural things, from which they have their name. But ſeparately they are neither ſufficient for themſelves nor others; that is, neither Fire without Water, nor
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30788:23"/>
Water without Fire, or otherwiſe neither Nature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Eſſence, nor Eſſence or ſubſtance without Nature can ſubſiſt. And this is that which the Philoſophers call the hot and humid temperament of all things; Namely, to continue in their ſtate, though (perchance) that one thing amongſt the reſt do prolong the life for many years: So that many have ſuppoſed that it was not able to continue or conſiſt, ſeeing that continually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion of time, the humour is conſumed by the force of the Heat; ſo that in a ſhort time the Heat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth ſingle in the place of the hot and moiſt tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, and at laſt it is brought to a hot and dry tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament; Again, the humour being conſumed and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and the Heat being deſtitute of aliment, by little and little it fadeth away, and drineſs altogether ſucceeds; and alſo the heat being diſ-jected and caſt forth of it, and diffuſed abroad very much, it begins to decay and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt; and ſo the dry and cold matter is left which is held to be the laſt of all. For the vital ſpirits whoſe force is fiery, do conſume nutriments and aliments hourly; ſo that there is need of continual reſtitution, mixtion and compoſition; therefore it is moſt truly ſaid of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> I find (ſaith he) that we are nouriſhed from thoſe things of which we conſiſt, and that by them generation and nutrition is continued. From hence Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is named of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſeed, becauſe in all ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there is the Balſam of the animal. Whether doth <hi>Gaeln</hi> make <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the chief in his folly or no? Let us (I pray you) pardon <hi>Galen,</hi> for he is ignorant of the Spagirical art, and hath never attained unto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> whereby it is come to paſs that he hath left the Eſſence of Nature untouched and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. As likewiſe he was ignorant of the forms of things, and therefore he could not obtain the forms of things from their bodies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:30788:24"/>For the confirmation of this, namely, that <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> underſtood by the name of Fire Nature it ſelf, we may bring the teſtimonies of other Philoſophers, leſt that we be thought to depend on the authority and judgment of one man alone; though that the teſtimony of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> being an excellent Philoſopher, might abundantly ſuffice us. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> alſo in his book writ of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Natural things, ſo alſo in his book <hi>de Electro,</hi> he calleth the Soul or Nature by the name of Fire; with whom <hi>Fernelius Alanus</hi> conſents in his Sayings which he hath conſecrated to poſterity, he calleth Nature by the name of Fire, of Wiſdom. <hi>Alexander</hi> a <hi>Suchten</hi> calleth Nature by the name of Living Fire. <hi>Raimundus Lullius</hi> calleth Nature the Living Fire of Nature; ſo alſo he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Living Fire by the name of Nature. <hi>Geber</hi> the Prince of Philoſophers calls this Fire of Nature the Incombu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible Sulphur. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in his firſt book of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Creation calleth this Fire by the name of Middle Nature; and forthwith in the ſame place he annexeth ſome few things, and calls it the Nature of Viridity or Greenneſs; for this is the bleſſed and happy Greenneſs which makes all things bud. This is the Green Lion of the Phyſicochemiſts, to the which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> aſcribes all the cures of all diſeaſes in his book <hi>de tincturaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum.</hi> The ancient Author in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> of the Spirit of the ſecret world, amongſt the reſt he affirmeth this celeſtial ſpirit (the Heaven) to exiſt in a wateriſh body more than perfect and clarified: he affirmeth this to be the inferious Heaven, whoſe ſparkle is the Alcool of wine, which is ſpirit, water, and fire. This is that which is ſo much commended of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; as alſo of other great Philoſophers of notable wits affirming thus, The Fire and <hi>Azoth</hi> are ſufficient for thee; which are the great myſteries of Nature, as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſpeaks in his <hi>Archidoxes.</hi>

                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:30788:24"/>In this place I have communicated and opened the gates of Nature by theſe which are ſaid very benignly; I might alſo bring more without envy, but that it is a caution in the laws of Philoſophy, That there be ſome tedious things left for the Scholars. Concerning the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted place of <hi>Hippocrates, Hippocrates</hi> explains himſelf in his firſt book <hi>de diaeta,</hi> which may fully certifie what he meaneth by the name of Fire; for (ſaith he) either Fire hath diſtinguiſhed (in the generation of Man) three cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits diverſe in faculties, yet conſpiring both in vardly and outwardly by a mutual ſociety, which have circuits in the cavities, which are workhouſes of the humours.<note place="margin">That is, in the Bowels which ſerve for nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> They relate the power, motion and maturity of the Moon; but thoſe which abſolve the reſolutions out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, where the more ſolid members conſiſt, do imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the properties of the Stars, which do conſiſt in the midſt, that is, in the heart; they contain the nature of moſt forcible fire, which is preſent without and within through all the parts, and hath dominion over them all; and it in ſecret ſilence is not perceived by ſight nor feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In this fire, that is in the Stars, the ſoul of this middle revolution, underſtanding, prudence, augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, motion, diminution, tranſmutation, ſleep, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, are ſecretly contained. The ſpirits being there me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical workers, are aſcending ſpiritual bodies, and they are the immediate inſtruments of the actions, and have roots. In the ſame book he hath deſcribed the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and ſciences of this Divine Nature. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith that Nature is the governour of men; this cauſes the attractions of the elements, the mixtions of the parts, diſpenſations, conſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30788:25"/>
altered and well-tempered mixtion. Furthermore, <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus</hi> calls Nature (as it were) a thing adorn'd with the Laws of the Fates: which word <hi>Hippocrates</hi> uſes, for there is a Law or Reaſon grounded in the eſſence of Nature, and it is that eſſence which impells, moves and governs all things; and, becauſe it is in bred, it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the decrees more ſorcibly. Becauſe of the diverſe in comprehenſible gifts of Nature, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaid that Nature was <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>I ſay, this Nature is the Vegetable ſecret of Nature, the vigour or efficacy of the name, the fruitful vertue of the light, which is of a perfect body, the bright force of Sulphur, the hidden virtue of the Heaven, the moſt pure la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>ALL living bodies, inaſmuch as they live, whether they be contained in the boſom of the Elements, and live obſcurely, or they live manifeſtly, (I ſay, all theſe) are compounded of three parts, namely Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>irit, and Body. The Body and Spirit may in ſome ſort be ſought forth by ſenſe; but the Soul and the eſſence of it, ſeeing it flies ſenſe, is obſecurely and too darkly known; for it is no obvious or eaſie thing to attain thereunto. Wherefore the underſtanding muſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it from the operations, functions and effects ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from thence, conſpicuous and objected unto the ſenſe, even as every occult cauſe is to be enquired and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30788:25"/>
ſought forth. Theſe are <hi>Aristotelical</hi> and <hi>Galenical</hi> opinions taken from the ſame ground. They endeavour to proportionate the anatomy of <hi>Troy</hi> by Geometrical partitions and figures, but in vain. Thus they define the Soul. The Soul is the beginning and cauſe of the functions of a living body. Or the Soul is the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Organical body. Seeing that every living body is forthwith an Organical body, every thing that giveth it life and cauſes the vital actions, is to be judged to be the Soul, which is the perfection of the whole.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, ſeeing that they can no other way know the eſſence, they leaving the obſcurity of eſſence do paſs unto the proper functions of it, which are more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, and they attain knowledge from the differences of the Soul; ſo they define the Soul to be life as from the proper functions of it; and from the differences of life they make certain kinds of the Soul, and ſo they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in their mind three differences of living things, namely, Natural, Senſitive and Intelligent: becauſe that ſome bodies do live by the benefit of ſole Nature, others have Sence, others are induced with Reaſon and Underſtanding; as if Sence and Reaſon were not aſwell natural, and have their foundations in the very eſſence of Nature; which thing <hi>Hippocrates</hi> expreſſes manifeſtly by a luculent teſtimony in his firſt Book <hi>de diata.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And theſe differences of living things are not to be aſcribed to their functions, faculties, ſciences, gifts and interior ſignatures, but rather to the Eſſence of the Soul. Here you may ſee the calamity of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> which are fallen, and do caſt themſelves headlong into very foul and unfortunate errours by their ſubtilty; for they do attribute that to the faculties and functions of the Soul, which are to be attributed to the very Eſſence. But they may ſay that that which is natural in Plants is a Soul, from which we ſay that Plants are animated
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30788:26"/>
though they be not animals; and that Senſitive faculty which governs and directs brute Beaſts is alſo a Soul, which doth not only make them animated, but alſo ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. Laſtly, there is none which will ſay that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective faculty of man is not a Soul. Theſe Souls are ſo ſevered and diſtracted that neither the Intelligent Soul of Man is a Senſitive Soul, nor the Senſitive Soul of a Beaſt is a Natural Soul. So that Man is not Beaſt, nor Beaſt is a Plant, otherwiſe there would be great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the kinds and natures of things. To whom I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Of what kind the ſciences and gifts of the natural ſpirits of the Soul, of the hot Fire, are, there are ſuch like ſignatures or ſealings expreſt in the bodies, and the whole ornature or comelineſs of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is contained in the anatomy, that is, in the Soul, for the Soul is the cauſe or beginning of the organical body, for from this the body is cauſed; by the vertue and power of it, the elements and principles are mixed, augmented and changed from ſpiritual into bodies having their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, magnitude, colours and ſuch paintings (that is) ſignatures agreeable to the Soul, which make much for the abſolving of the pre-ordinated functions and offices. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> doth illuſtrate the unity of the Soul by an excellent teſtimony in his Book <hi>de diaeta,</hi> ſaith he, Male and Female may conſiſt together, and each one conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute other; and he addeth this reaſon, becauſe the ſame Soul is in all living bodies, but the body of them all do differ. Therefore the Soul is the like as well in a greater as a leſs (that is) in an infant as one come to years; for it is not altered neither by Nature or Neceſſity; but the body is never the ſame either by Nature or Neceſſity. Now it is ſeparated from all, otherwiſe it were commix'd. Here he calleth the Soul the Root and the vital begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, becauſe this thing is common to both Sexes in all kinds of animals, therefore they may conſiſt together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:30788:26"/>Again, the Male and Female are rooted in the ſame root and mutually propagate themſelves; for the Souls which are vital beginnings, and the radical tinctures of things, are ſtable and perpetual, not ſubjected to mixtion; therefore they perſiſt the ſame and altogether like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,<note place="margin">The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Soul.</note> whether they be in leſs Individual things (that is) in weaker and unfirmer, or in greater (that is) in more ſtronger and firmer.</p>
                  <p>The unity of the Soul being thus demonſtrated, I call the Soul Vitalſpirits, the <hi>Chorionium</hi> of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> the Powers of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Spiritual and Vital powers, Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, Vital qualities, which being diſperſed through the whole anatomy of the living body, nevertheleſs they are concentred and united in the more principal parts, which communicate true eſſence to the body. The Eſſence of this Soul though it be obſcure and unknown of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Gallen,</hi> nevertheleſs it is perſpicuous and manifeſt enough to us; for by the induſtry of the workman it is ſubjected to the eye, which we call the Native liquor, the Radical moiſture, the myſtery, the mean of the Soul, the golden vigour of the Soul, the flowr of the Soul, and the efficacy of the ſpirit in the elements, which we call <hi>Jupiter</hi> in heaven, <hi>Juno</hi> in the air, <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> in the water, and in each of the parts of theſe the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients have called it by divers names of the Gods.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30788:27"/>
congreſs, mixtion and temperature of the elements. Theſe are the famous doubts which obſcure very much the knowledge of natural things, from this fountain there is derived an overthrow which hath corrupted all Philoſophy, and begot obſcurity and tranſplantation by the Laws, and confuſe adminiſtration of mixtion.</p>
                  <p>In whoſe ſteps muſt we now inſiſt? whom ſhall we truſt? ſhall we truſt ancient Writers, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen?</hi> Unto theſe <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> methinks I hear <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeak, who many years before the hiſtory of the created World, following the Eternal God, and inſtructed in all kind of things, ſaid, that God had put a natural power or vertue in the created heaven which ſhould be unto us for ſigns and ſeaſons, and that he filled the World with all kind of living things, which things being mortal, leſt that their continuance and kind ſhould decay, he gave a foreſeeing divine vertue (in his Wiſdom) to ſeeds, whereby by propagation they might conſerve unto all ages the living herb and fruitfuful tree; likewiſe he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the fruit and the ſeed every one in his kind to bring forth and multiply, to conſerve their kind. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are worthily to be laughed at, which aſcribe the Original of forms not only to the Sun and Moon, but alſo to the poſition of other Stars; for how ſhall Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables receive the Original of forms from the Stars, which were created before the Stars were formed? for he hath had dominion over the Whales of the Sea, and all kind of fiſhes, birds, beaſts, and man, that they by their multiplying might fill the World. So the chief workman of all things while he framed all by the word and breath of his mouth, he inſpired procreative vertues, by which the wonderful continuation and order of things might be conſerved: Therefore farewel <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel <hi>Galen,</hi> and all thoſe which do not agree with the ſacred Scripture, and thoſe which hear not <hi>Moſes</hi> the

Interpreter of the living Philoſophy. We do not ſay as <hi>Zarabella</hi> would have, That the Heaven is the univerſal efficient cauſe of the generation and corruption of all things in this inferiour world; but they are all vegetant in the ſeed, which are ſeen to flow and reflow by the courſe of generation and corruption; (that is) to be made or to decay. So that the form of every thing ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth freely and naturally, and it is native, natural, and happeneth not outwardly. It is not deduced from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor it riſes not from the commixtion of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor it is not derived from the momentany poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Stars in regard of the inferiour nature: But that ſoul is in man, and that diverſly. Theſe are the Opinions of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> not ſtraying from the ſacred Scripture, nigh unto the decrees of the <hi>Platonicks,</hi> with whom <hi>Hippocrates</hi> agrees altogether in his book <hi>de diaeta.</hi> Notwithſtanding I do not deny the ſuperiour and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our conſpiration, conſent, and conflux; which thing <hi>Hermes</hi> would ſeem to have ſignified in theſe words, <hi>It is true without falſhood, it is certain and moſt true that, that below is as that above, and that above is as that below.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30788:28"/>
which manner of Doctrine we have hitherto imit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ted, that we may ſuppoſe it to be altogether abſolute and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Secondly, though all living things by the unity of their life do imitate their beginnings, their examples; yet we muſt conſider whether there be any differences and degrees of their Lives, as of the vital Baulm. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how we may come to the vital fountains of Nature, by what proportion and by what means, and by what mechanical proceſs it may beſt be fitted for mans uſe and neceſsity. The perfect knowledge of theſe three, if that it concur in any, it conſtitutes and makes a true Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the other, which neceſſarily is required in a Philoſopher, namely the differences and degrees of Lives, as alſo of Baulm. The difference of Life (as the Philoſophers ſpeak) conſiſts in this, that ſome live manifeſtly, ſome occultly and hiddenly. Again, in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things Life is either corporeal or ſpiritual: The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual is apprehended to be in all Animals. It is decreed by the wonderful myſtery of Nature, that all the kinds of things ſhould excell by a divinity of their actions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was meet that many inſtruments of their actions ſhould actually be manifeſted: for the ſolid and ſimilar firm matter of Baulm could not admit ſuch actions. For all the actions ariſe from the ſpirits in the living body; and for the diverſe tincture, impreſſion and confluence which they receive in divers places they produce divers actions. So that if they occupy the movable parts, then they cauſe motion; if the ſenſible parts, then they cauſe ſenſe; in other places, the concoctions and ſeparations of the excrements, diſtributions of the nutriments, and nutritions ſhall be governed and ordered thereby. Here they admit the memorable tinctures of formidity, and the neceſſary preparations to be begot.</p>
                  <p>We have above ſaid, that the Vital ſpirits in Animals,<note place="margin">Cap. 6. de Natura.</note>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:30788:29"/>
by reaſon of their force of operation, conſume the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Baulm hourly: and therefore there is need of daily inſtauration, mixtion and repleniſhing to propagate and produce life. From theſe we underſtand that the ſtable life in Animals hath not admitted the matter of Baulm; wherefore it is not ſubject to the will of Artiſts. Theſe are confirmed of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in his <hi>Archidoxes;</hi> for he ſaid, that neither the Quinteſſence or the true Balm can be derived or deduced from the company or bodies of Animals. Thoſe Medicines which are made from Animals, as from their fleſh, bloud, morrow, or fat, ought to be referr'd unto the order of the Vegetables, from which they are nouriſhed and are begot.</p>
                  <p>The Corporeal life is in all things lurking and lying hid in the centre of the Elements. Thoſe which do live obſcurely, are thoſe which do manifeſt either no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of the Sex, or elſe hidden, which are not diſtracted with the variety of ſenſible and movable operaions and offices: and therefore they exhibit a matter ſubject to the wills of the Artiſts, which adminiſter in the Herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditical nature of the Baulm the mere generations and tranſplantations of the<note place="margin">Becauſe the foundation is in one root, the Sex is Male and Female. <hi>Muffetus</hi> in his Apologetical Dialogue of the Chemical Medicines, fol. 28, 29, 30.

                  <p>PHiloſophers do greatly diſſent in the handling of the Principles, and every one almoſt led by his own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion doth bring his own beginnings. Some do conſiſt in Reaſon only, and are not grounded in Nature, they admit no demonſtrations from the light of Nature. Thoſe which hold theſe imaginary beginnings, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed in the Knowledge and Inquiſition of the Eſſential Cauſes; they are drawn by a blind and a terminary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour upward and downward, they admit a diſſolute and futile or vain confuſion of things, wavering this way and that way without ſinews and joynts; they ſtick in all things as if they were but beginners, they hold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is ratified, nothing that is comprehended, and nothing that is fixed and ſure: But they ever ſtand in that place, and in doubt, from which they may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with a light moment, which daily Experience, not only in Philoſophy, but alſo in Phyſicks, doth teſtifie and approve. But according to theſe fine Philoſophers and Phyſicians if it pleaſe God, ſome beginnings are of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, ſome of Phyſick; and where the Philoſopher endeth there the Phyſician beginneth. <hi>Aristole,</hi> the chief of the <hi>Peripatetical</hi> Family or Sect, made three be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of Nature, two Eſſential as he calleth them, Namely, the Matter, and the Form, and one Accidental, namely, Privation, which beginnings ſeeing they do alone comprehend them in mind, and abſtract them from the very Eſſence of the thing, and do not explain
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30788:30"/>
what the Matter of a natural thing is; nevertheleſs they would be thought to explain and lay open the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Matter. Let me define them.
<list>
                        <item>The Matter is, of which a thing is made.</item>
                        <item>The Form is, by which a thing is made.</item>
                        <item>Privation is, the abſence of the Form.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet it remaineth unexplained altogether what the true, real, and eſſential beginnings of Nature are. All the Spagirical Philoſophers have made a Matter, and confeſſed there was a Form, and that a new Form was forthwith induced, the old being aboliſhed and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; where cloſely the neceſſity of Privation is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But while they imagine of theſe in their mind, they conſider the true ſubjects of Nature. Wherefore whoſoever is inſtructed with theſe imaginary beginnings, will never come to the Bath of <hi>Diana,</hi> wherefore he need not fear the puniſhments of <hi>Acteon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galen</hi> held that the Elements adorned with their Qualities were the Foundations of Nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hermes ter maximus</hi> the Father of the Phloſophers, taught that all things were generated of three things; he explains the terminary number, calling them Spirit, Soul, and Body, though he doth not expreſly ſhew what he meaneth by Spirit, Soul, and Body, yet our <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> hath ſo expounded them no leſs artificially than natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raly in his Book <hi>de Naturarerum.</hi> The Spirit is Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Soul is Sulphur, the Body is Salt. The mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Spirit and the Body (of which <hi>Hermes</hi> ſpeaks) is the Soul; ſo that the mean betwixt Mercury and Salt is Sulphur, which unites, conjoyns, and couples diverſe things, and compounds them into one ſubſtance of a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Now we will ſeek forth the Original differences and properties of theſe three; theſe are they which have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30788:30"/>
wearied and aſtonied the Wits of many Philoſophers, our beginnings of our <hi>Paracelſus</hi> have true Foundations in Nature, Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury, are the iſſues and off-ſpring of the Seeds. In the firſt framing of creatures it was needful that the Seeds ſhould have their Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in others, ſeeing they were gone from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Unity. If the images of the Seeds, (that is) the Seeds themſelves ſhould be diſperſed; it was alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the images of the Elements, (that is) for the beginnings to imitate Nature. So the Eſſence, Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, Life, and Act of all things are the Elements, (that is) the Seeds which are beginnings, but yet not common or general beginnings. For the more full underſtanding of this thing, in the firſt place the difference of Bodies is to be obſerved. Some Bodies are more nigh their beginnings, namely, the Seeds and Vital beginnings. Others have gone further from them, as the mix'd Elements. Thoſe which are more nigh by reaſon of the likeneſs of their Nature are called Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bodies, Spiritual, and Vital, and conſtant Vegetable Bodies, in which the conſtant property of every body is apprehended. Theſe are called of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt. Not that they are altogether like to the vulgar Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury in Subſtance; but in Eſſence, Actions, and Properties; and as much as thoſe perfect individuals in their kind do differ amongſt themſelves, ſo much do theſe Vital beginnings differ in Eſſence, Actions, and Properties. Thoſe which are more remote from the Seeds, are called Earthly, Craſs, Mixt, Dead, and Unfixt Bodies; theſe are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Elements commixed with the beginnings, which do exhibit or propound before our ſenſes one ſimilar ſubſtance of the Bodies by the virtue of mixtion.</p>
                  <p>The beginnings which we name firſt of the two are formal and natural Bodies, but yet ſpiritual, they are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:30788:31"/>
yet corporeal; ſo that in ſome ſort they are means betwixt the corporeal and incorporeal Nature. The latter are bonds of viſible and inviſible things, of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and eternal, corruptible and incorruptible, of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour and inferiour; therefore they ought to manifeſt the properties of the ſuperiour and inferiour Nature. So that they purely and exquiſitely do not repreſent the conditions of either of them. He which knows not theſe bonds hath not learned the power of life, becauſe he hath only exerciſed the anatomy of death. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> coupled death and life together, and they would have attributed things belonging to dead things without qualities to the living things, they both labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for one end. Furthermore, in theſe ſpirits and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bodies, the properties of all natural actions do bear ſway, and all ſeparations, digeſtions, and concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Nature are abſolved and perfected by the benefit of Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, and not by the benefit or miniſtery of Heat and Humidity. The temperament of all the parts are not integrated or compounded from the mixtion of Heat, Cold, and Drineſs, but from the mixti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury amongſt themſelves, and with the Elements, which agree in the Sciences and Predeſtinations of the foreſaid beginnings and root or ground. And this is the temperament of Nature, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf, and the towardneſs or good diſpoſition of things produced from the Sciences and Signatures of the beginnings; for the properties of the actions which; are contemplated and beheld in the natural parts, as of Attraction, Retention, Separation, Digeſtion, and Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, we deprehend them to be in the anatomy of Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury; even as the Sulphur of the Loadſtone attracteth iron and worn Amber attracteth ſtraw; oftentimes alſo we deprehend it to be in outward things. And though theſe three beginnings of Bodies

ſeem to have their forces united in Nature, yet they reſerve the properties without hurt and confuſion. The office and property of Salt is to congeal Bodies and to make them ſolid and firm; from hence is the hardneſs of the Adamant, and the ſolidneſs of Gold, which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> aſcribe to Cold.</p>
                  <p>The office of Sulphur is, being of a fat and clammy ſubſtance, to temperate the foreſaid congelation with a benign commixtion, leſt that the mechanical Spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound and girded with the ſolidneſs and commixt proportion of Salt ſhould commit unjuſt loſſes of their actions and offices.</p>
                  <p>The office of Mercury is, to repair and cheriſh by continual moiſtning thoſe which haſten unto drineſs and age, and to make the mixtion of them to be of a ſluid and moveable ſubſtance; for this neceſſity Mercury is adjoyned to Salt and Sulphur, but more ſparingly and in a leſs meaſure, in the Vital beginning the Elements are in the Vital ſulphur, the Firſt Matter, and the Balm; and theſe three Bodies Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury. (that is) the Balm makes and compounds the Domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal principles or beginnings like unto themſelves from the Elements, ſo that it requires the common and latter Elements as external Veſtments.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three by whoſe miniſtery or benefit all things are connext and do conſpire together, are the Bonds of the corporeal continuity of all Bodies.

                     <p>Concerning the Foundation or ground of Generation. Three things are required neceſſary to the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every Generation. Firſt, the Elements, and Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Secondly, Seeds, Stars, Firſt Matter or Soul. Thirdly, the beginnings of bodies. All which, though divers, yet they are contained in the leaſt portion of the matter, which is altogether ſimilar, as appeareth by the teſtimony of the ſenſe; and ſo they command us to worſhip the Divinity of Nature; neither are they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly or raſhly comprehended, but they are inſtructed with a Vital and moſt forcible Power or Vertue, and with an infallible ſcience. It will bring much light to our contemplations if we explain the offices of theſe. There are more common offices of the Elements, the Matrices or Receptacles, and they obtain the name of the matter, they are the offices of the ſeeds, the firſt matter or ſtars. Furthermore, they are called fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becauſe they are the Bonds of viſible and inviſible things, and becauſe they contain in them the Laws of Motions, the Predeſtination of Times, and the Laws of Generations, Mixtions, and Tranſplantations, as in the efficient agent cauſe, from which all actions proceed. The beginnings of bodies are deſtinated to properties and actions, and they bear ſway with the wonderful Power or Vertue of the qualities or properties. Theſe are the Laws of the Generation of natural things, that the ſeeds and ſtars do come forth of the Fountains and Deeps and dark places into light, and out of the <hi>Iliadum</hi> into the Worlds anatomy, the Principles of the Bodies being conſtituted and aſſumed at defined and ſet times, and by the renovation of the Individuals and production of bodies, conſerve the property of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:30788:34"/>
ſpirits. This renovation of bodies is a Generation whoſe Foundation confiſts in the ſeed.</p>
                     <p>In this Lithurgy and action of ſeeds and ſtars, viſible things are made and generated from inviſible things, corporeal things from incorporeal things, by the vertue and power of the immortal and vital ſcience, bearing ſway in Nature, which ſcience he handleth above in the ſixth Chapter of his Philoſophy. We ſaid that it was the light of Nature, and the predeſtination of <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> By the power and work of it the Elements are made thus and thus, (that is) either Mineral, or Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or Animal Elements, for there is in Nature a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, Mineral, and an Animal Earth, and there is a Vegetable, Mineral, and Animal Water, the like of the Air and of the Fire. And by it the beginnings of the bodies agreeable to the offices of the ſeeds and ſtars are extant and come forth. So colours, ſmells, taſts, heat, cold, moiſtneſs, drineſs, quantity, number, confirmation, all vital qualities and other ſignatures do proceed in the mechanical proceſs of Generation. Becauſe no Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be perfected without Mixtion, we will forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with intreat of it.</p>
                     <p>Mixtion is the Inſtrument of the ſeed proceeding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Generation, by whoſe miniſtery the Elements and the beginnings of bodies which agree with the ſeeds, and domeſtical things, as Animals united to Animals, Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals to Minerals, Vegetables to Vegetables, ſo emulate the unity of the ſeeds which are their examples.</p>
                     <p>The foundation of Mixtion is the vital beginning, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed with an effective ſcience; the form, the idaea, the ſeed, the ſtar, by whoſe power and infallible ſcience, divine offices of mixtion are adminiſtred. This is that eſpecial ſtar or ſeed which we have demonſtrated to be the Foundation or ground of all Generations.</p>
                     <p>The Term or bound and ſubjects of mixtions, are the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:30788:34"/>
Elements and beginnings of bodies produced from ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by vertue and ſcience of the mechanical ſpirits, for the mixtion is made, when bodies are conſtituted of incorporeal things, but yet altogether ſpiritual bodies, The Laws of mixtion are three ways conſidered. The firſt, is the mixtion of the Elements amongſt themſelves. The ſecond, is the mixtion of the Elements with the principles or beginnings. The third, is the mixtion of the principles amongſt themſelves, and of all them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for if they ought to exhibit one ſimilar ſubſtance of a body unto the ſenſes, then there ought to be three be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, and each one mixt. Again, the manner of Mixtion is threefold, for either a perfect is mixt with a perfect, or a corruptible or impure with a corruptible, or a perfect with a corruptible.</p>
                     <p>The mixtion happeneth far otherwiſe, if a perfect be mixt with a perfect, (that is) a pure with a pure, than if an impure or corruptible be mixt with an impure or pure; for the beginnings, elements, and foundations of bodies are twofold, they are either perfect, or the firſt, (that is) the immediate receptacles of the ſeeds, which are the nigheſt to the ſeeds, as are the beginnings of bodies, or they are corruptible or ſuperadded, (that is) which are more remote from the ſeeds and the ſtars, as are the Elements which bear the name of a Matter; how much therefore the ſubjects of mixtion differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, ſo much the unions, terms, or limits and continuance do differ; for pure permixt with pure things (that is) which are more remote from the impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Elements, have a longer time of digeſtion, and comem later to their diſſolution, as are Gold, Siver, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, which are meer individual principles altogether perfect and ſeparated from the external im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities of the Elements. The impure haſten quickly to corruption, ſome of them ſooner ſome later, according
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:30788:35"/>
to the analogy and proportion of the ſubjects. The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and beginnings of Animals have times of their continuance very much diſtinct from the Elements and principles of Minerals and Vegetables, and theſe Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and Vegetables do differ much from the procreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſuperiour Globe, (that is) from the fruits of the ſuperiour Elements. We will handle more largely of corruptible things, Foundations, Elements, and Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and of the mixtion of them with Pure in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Diſeaſes, for they contain the anatomy of Diſeaſes and Death. Seeing therefore there be divers manners of Generations by reaſon of the Elements and Seeds, ſo that in ſome the differences of the Sex is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neglected, as in Minerals and Metals. In ſome the Rudiments or beginnings of the ſex do appear ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, as in Vegetables. In ſome they appear manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a perfect ſeparation of the Individuals, and their properties expreſſed, as in Animals.</p>
                     <p>Theſe manners of Generations being rightly explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do make much for the right underſtanding of the Generation of Diſeaſes, we will explain all in order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the Minerals.</p>
                     <p>In the Generation of Minerals, (which is very hard to be underſtood of thoſe which cannot apprehend the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed phraſes of Philoſophers) firſt there is to be obſerved the connexion of thoſe things which are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Generation. There is a twofold connexion; the firſt of principles and principles, the ſecond of principles with elements.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we muſt obſerve that this Generation of Minerals is of Conſanguinity with Nature; for there is no Generation neither of Vegetables nor Animals ſo nigh the Fountains of Nature, neither do approch ſo nigh the Fountains of Unity, as the Generation of Minerals; though ſome Minerals have their admixt impurities; for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:30788:35"/>
Minerals are the Off-ſpring and Iſſue of the ſeeds, the Off-ſpring and Children of the ſtars and ſeeds lying hidden in the Element of Water, which Iſſue have all the gifts of their Parents, the ſciences, ſignatures, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties thereof by an hereditary right, and they poſſeſſe them inviolated; furthermore, the Minerals have moſt effective Balm, and they poſſeſſe almoſt a ſolid and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous Matter, and they have peirced the Vital principle, (that is) the whole ſubſtance of the Matter, and proportionated it unto themſelves. So the ſtar or ſeed in this kind of Minerals hath perfected ſome perfect Individuals, not only according to their ſubſtance, but according to the vertues of Nature, which being ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and fenced in with the abundance and purity of Balm, they are not deprived of their ſtrength in many years, neither are they corrupted with any external inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, for example; <hi>Mercury,</hi> of which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſpeaks, is a perpetual Moon, neither can it be corrupted by any violence or injury, by reaſon of the firmneſs and perfection of the Balm exiſting in the <hi>Mercury; Mercury</hi> is called the Renewer and Reſtorer of mans body. So alſo the Antimony (of all the Waters) is the beſt Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, in which ſo great power and vertue of Balm is occult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contained, ſo that it is able to cure all deſperate and deplored Diſeaſes, as well ſharp Diſeaſes as Chronical. What ſhall I ſay of Vitriol? which alone is able to cure the fourth part of all Diſeaſes, and to root out altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Tartareous Diſeaſes. I let paſſe Sulphur indued with infinite properties, and Sal-niter which helpeth and cureth the greateſt Diſeaſes beyond our expectation, ſo alſo I let paſſe <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> Margarits and Corals and other Individuals of this kind.</p>
                     <p>The Minerals demonſtrate their Vital qualities with ſuch a vertue of their actions, and they demonſtrate the differences of the Vital qualities, that is, of the firſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:30788:36"/>
qualities from which all actions proceed, from them <hi>Paracelſus</hi> fetches ſeeds which are Vigent and bear ſway in the Treaſures of the Elements, for to adminiſter the Worlds province, and that they might come forth into aſpect, they do unite with the Spirits, but yet with ſuch Spirits as of which bodies may be conſtituted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. And this Wedlock or Union is the connexion of the ſeeds and principles. Afterward when as they have found forth fit Matrices and Receptacles (for every Element bringeth forth the Fruits, not in his own proper place, but in a ſtrange or unuſual place) they admit ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the company of viſible bodies, than of compound and mixt bodies.</p>
                     <p>Then the Elements conſtitute not the common bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but the bodies proper unto the Minerals. In like manner the principles of bodies, (that is) Mineral Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, Mineral Salt, and Mineral Mercury, do conſtitute Mineral Fire, and Mineral Air, Earth, and Water, and this is the union or connexion of the Elements and Principles. Theſe being abſolved and perfected they produce all Congelations, Colours, Signatures which are Vegetive in the ſeeds, ſtars, or Vital principles thereof, and they demonſtrate Metals or Minerals very nigh unto Metals.</p>

                     <p>This is that which <hi>Severinus Davus</hi> pag. 124 ſaith, by the great power of Nature we have wondred and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired in the ſeed of the Minerals not only the unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed variety of the Sex, but alſo the united principles of the Individuals and Spirits in one and the ſame ſeed.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the myſteries and ſecrets and wonderful things of God placed in the Majeſty of Nature. Let theſe ſuffice concerning the Generation of the Element of Water. Now we proceed to the Generation of the Element of Earth, and we will intreat of Vegetables. All Vegetables are thoſe which have Roots fixt and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened into the Earth, and are ſuſtained by a Vegetive Soul: Furthermore, <hi>Plato</hi> called the Plants Animated or Vegetables. There are eſpecial differences of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, in regard of the Elements and of the ſeeds. The ſeeds and ſtars are ever the ſame in Nature, Virtue and Eſſence, but the Elements differ much amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſubtileneſs and moveableneſs, as the Element of Water is more ſubtile and moveable than the Earth,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:30788:37"/>
ſo the fruits and things generated from it are more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, moveable, valid or firm and more excellent, than the fruits or things begot from the Earth. From hence it is that the ſeeds of Vegetables have a clammy, ſoft, craſs body in reſpect of the Minerals and Animals, whoſe ſeeds are more ſpiritual and ſubtile bodies.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the manner of Generation of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, thoſe which proceed of their own accord without mans induſtry have almoſt the ſame manner of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration with the Minerals; for the ſeeds of Vegetables riſe forth of the Matrix of the Earth, and at firſt unite with the Spirits, and ſo conſtitute their principles. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable Salt, Vegetable Sulphur, begot Vegetable Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, Vegetable Water, and Vegetable Fire, Earth, and Air. But this is to be obſerved which is moſt worthy to be noted, that the fruits or effects of every Element re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and reſerve the properties, nature, and conditions of the Matrix in which they lie hidden from the beginning, and they never depoſe them. So <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in his third book 2 Chap. of degrees, brought this difference, he made the fruits or the effects of the Earth to be of the firſt degree, the fruits of the Air to be of the ſecond, the fruits of the Water to be of the third, to the fruits of the Fire he aſcribeth the fourth degree, where he adjoyneth theſe words; he laboureth in vain whoſoever he be which would get the quinteſſence out of Earthly things, which is like to that which is got forth of Air. In like manner that quinteſſence which is from the Air cannot be compared to that which is brought forth of the Water; upon this Sentence ſo it is to be judged of the fourth Element Concerning the extracting of the quinteſſence forth of the herb <hi>Chelondine,</hi> it is not that thou labour to attain the quinteſſence of Gold by the quinteſſence of <hi>Chelondine,</hi> though there be more ſecret in <hi>Balmemint, Chelondine</hi> and <hi>Valerian,</hi> than in the reſt, only ſo far
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:30788:37"/>
proceeds the degree that the ſecret may excel in many parts; ſo that in every degree one Element exiſts higher than another; wherefore it is to be obſerved in things made of Earth, whether the <hi>Chelondine</hi> excel the <hi>Balm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mint,</hi> and whether the <hi>Balmmint</hi> excel the <hi>Valerian;</hi> ſo likewiſe it is to be judged of the three other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>The ſpontaney or free Generation of the Vegetables cometh nigheſt unto Nature, and is almoſt like the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Minerals, excepting that the ſeed of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals according to their Plantation are not ſubjected to the wills of men, neither do they conſerve perpetuity (as the Vegetables) by propagation of Individuals.</p>
                     <p>The ſeeds of Vegetables are twofold. The Aſtral ſeeds which are only ſubject to Nature. Secondly, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſeeds which are ſubject to the ſenſe and will of man, as of Barley, Wheat, Oats, and other pulſe which ſpring not but by Induſtry and good Husbandry.</p>
                     <p>In Plants there be divers manners of propagation, but in Minerals at leaſt there is but one manner, and it is ſpontaney, or of free accord, cauſed by no labour of man. Some Vegetables are propagated by mans Induſtry and Husbandry, by material ſeeds or grains, either round, or three cornered, or long, &amp;c. Some Vegetables are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by Graffs, as Vines, ſome by Branches or Boughs, as Willows, very many from Roots pulled up. There are divers times of the ſpringing and riſing of theſe ſeeds whether aſtral or material. Some ſpring in Summer, ſome in the Spring, ſome in Autumn, ſome in the beginnning, middle, or end of the Spring, or Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or Autumn, ſome ſpring in <hi>Cancer,</hi> or in <hi>Libra,</hi> or in <hi>Virgo,</hi> or in <hi>Leo,</hi> and then come forth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>He will admire the confluence of Nature, which marketh the ſpringing and budding of Plants at the riſing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:30788:38"/>
and ſetting of certain Stars. There are alſo certain fit places required in the Generation of Vegetables, as the Poplar tree, and the Willow, and Arſmart love the Waters, the Trifoil, Ragwort, the Coſlip and Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, the Origan and the herb Groundpinn love the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; of which <hi>Virgil</hi> in his 1 book of his <hi>Georgicks</hi> writes thus, here will good Corn riſe, there will Grapes ſpring plenteouſly; and in another place good Apples will grow and flouriſhing Graſſe. And again in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of his <hi>Georgicks,</hi> he ſaith, every ground cannot bring forth all fruits. The Willows ſpring at the waters ſide, the Alder-trees in the foggy Fens, the barren wild Aſh-trees grow on ſtony mountains, the Sea ſhores are moſt pleaſant with Mirtles, our Ladygloves affect hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, the Yew-tree loves the Northwind and cold of the Air; and he addeth the cauſe in the ſecond of his <hi>Georgicks,</hi> for ſurely it is only Nature.</p>
                     <p>This is by reaſon of the temperament and friendly conſpiration of ſuperiour and inferiour things, for the ſeeds having an in-bred knowledge do all Fructifie as Seaſons, and in their places; for the conſtitution of the air is otherwiſe about the waters or flouds, than in the valleys, in which the Sun-beams by their great power cannot peirce and temperate the turbulent and craſſe air. The conſtitution of the air about little mountains is divers from that about great mountains, for the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſuperiour and inferiour things is chiefly to be conſidered in the Generations of the inferiour Globe, if that the prevarications of the confluences, and the dearth of Corn bring great defect. There are three eſpecial differences of Generations in this inferiour Globe of Minerals, Vegetables, and Animals.</p>
                     <p>In the Element of Water four kinds of fruits appear, Salts, Minerals, Gemms, and Stones, by one name call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Minerals.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:30788:38"/>There are only two kinds of fruits from the Element of Earth, Plants, and Trees, called Vegetables, which being explained we will deſcend to the Generation of Animals. The vital principle of the Nature of Animals is grounded in a certain Radical matter, namely, in ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Balſam, in Suphur and vital Liquor, which two, namely, the vital Principle or native Heat, and radical moiſture or firſt-begot moiſture, have made a conſtant and firm Wedlock or Union, as we have demonſtrated in our Philoſophy, <hi>de calore native.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This firſt matter of Animals, though in ſpiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tileneſs it excel the Balſam of Vegetables and Minerals, neither is it grounded in a matter ſubject to the wills and judgment of man, nevertheleſs it hath moſt effective tinctures in it, in which as though in mechanical ſpirits the knowledge of the anatomy of all the parts of the animal are ſecretly contained, for the leaſt dram of the ſeed contains the anatomy of the whole kind; becauſe the mechanical ſpirits and Principles of the bodies are taken from the Dimenſions and Straitneſs of bodies, (that is) the Firſt matter or ſtars of animals is not ſubjected to Geometrical Demonſtrations. Here the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> contend that this ſeminal matter is only contained in the anatomy of the Teſticles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith that ſeed is derived from the moſt ſtrong and forcible Root of the whole animal; he teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it by this note, becauſe ſo little matter being eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated there are made very great mutations and great loſſe of the ſtrength in the body.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing in the body more ſtrong than the animal Balſam or vital Sulphur. Hereupon <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in his book <hi>de ſagaci Philoſophia,</hi> calls this Radical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the quinteſſence of <hi>Lmibicagaſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From hence the Philoſophers called the ſeed of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals the viridity of Nature, and the flowr of ſtrength;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:30788:39"/>
though we deny not but that the crude and imperfect matter, which is in place for a covering wherewith the mechanical ſpirits and principles of Generation are inveſted, is perfected and digeſted and brought unto maturity by the perfecting of the members of Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, otherwiſe Generation were fruſtrate and in vain, not by the inconſtancy of the mechanical ſpirits and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal principle, but by the imperfection and debility of the bodies. This is the true original of ſeed, and the Nature in Animals. From theſe it appeareth that the ſeed, the Animal Balſam, is not only contained in the Teſticles or Brain, or Sperm of the marrow, but that it is diffuſed through the whole body, (that is) through the whole anatomy of the Animal, and it is the vital Liquor, the Radical matter, the Firſt matter; for theſe vertues and faculties which have flown forth of the whole body, eſpecially out of the principal parts, together with the ſpirits, do inhere and remain in that matter of the ſeed, being prepared and perfected in the Teſticles, and are as it were the miſtreſſes or workers of procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> contends by many reaſons that he might ſhew that women neither have ſeed, nor do emit or ſend forth any in the Venereal act. But the contrary may be taught, eſpecially by this reaſon, becauſe women have Teſticles and Veſſels for ſeed, all which if Nature did not make them in vain (as it makes nothing in vain) have likewiſe a faculty of generating ſeed attributed them, which is the cauſe thereof. The truth of this matter is proved by the teſtimony of ſenſe; for it is ſeen in women which have longer refrained from coiture, that their ſeed would flow about the Veſſels being cut, as well as in men, but in the Teſticles there is a more craſs and perfect ſeed, becauſe women will confeſs that by dreams their ſeed is ſent forth with no leſs pleaſure than in coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:30788:39"/>
In widdows and thoſe which have longer abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Venery, by dreams and by tickling of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties abundant and craſs ſeed will burſt forth. This is not only confirmed by the whole teſtimony of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but humane nature doth abundantly confirm this unto thoſe which know it. From hennce it is collected, that the ſeed of woman concurs unto Generation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a woman afflicted or pained with the falling Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Stone, or Gout in the Legs, brings forth Children affected with thoſe Hereditary Diſeaſes. Laſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Child is very often like the Mother, which things the Mothers bloud cannot effect, but the ſeed which is diffuſed from her. Furthermore, neither the ſeed of the man, nor of the woman can effect any thing by it ſelf, being ſolitary, in a perfect Generation, but the conflux and true mixtion of both ſeeds are required unto perfect Generation, for the mixtion being fruſtrate Generation decays. The motion of Generation in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect animals, in which there is a perfect diſtinction of the Sex of male and female, is a wiſe and provident Nature of things inciting and ſtirring them up ſometime to the propagation of Generation, leſt that the whole kind ſhould decay, and it hath injected or put luſt as a prick into them both from the heat of the ſeed, and it hath given a pleaſantneſs or wonderful deſire of coiture unto the privities, that they might bring their ſeed into one, otherwiſe they would be altogether unprofitable, which concurring and rightly conſpiring the ſeed of the male and the female received in the womb are mixt with a mutual embracing, for ſpiritual things are agreeable and do conſpire and ariſe from one and the ſame Root, and they have the ſame gifts: for like do congratulate and delight to be with like, and domeſtical things, with domeſtical things having the ſame faculties, or ſciences, and ſignatures. After that they be mixt the womb con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:30788:40"/>
them moſt cloſely, and hideth them in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, holding it ſo cloſely on every ſide that it ſuffers no ſpace to be empty within; and alſo it contracts and girds in it ſelf, and doth ſo ſtraiten or compreſs and ſhut the mouth of it, (that is) it doth ſo much rejoyce in the friendly gueſt received, ſo that it will not open at all. But the mouth of the neck of the womb, namely, the outward mouth, ſometimes lies open unto the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities. The womb hath two mouths, which thing <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batius</hi> demonſtrates 23 Aphoriſm and 6 book, for the ſeeds being permixt and conceived in the womb, there is the ſame force and the ſame nature in them both. And becauſe the mechanical ſpirits and Radical tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures have brought with them the abundant ſtore of vital heat, as the motion of theſe ſpirits ſhall forthwith appear, though it be obſcure, ſo the offices of the heart and arteries will forthwith appear, and by their vital pulſe attract aery and ſpiritual aliment through the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ways or paſſages according unto the ſcience and power of the mechanical ſpirits, for all things do appear unto Nature as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> witneſſeth. Furthermore, the more ſmall or pure and hot parts of the ſeed, and thoſe which more participate of ſpirits; or ſpiritual tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures do fly inwardly into the midſt of the whole maſs, but the more Craſs or Earthly parts of the ſeed, do compaſs and go about thoſe ſpiritual ſpirits, from which the mechanical ſpirits do produce the membranes which wrap the Child.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the firſt Rudiments or Grounds of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Animals. But here <hi>Galen, Fernel,</hi> and other <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotelians</hi> contend with <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and contradict him, in that in his book <hi>de locis in homine,</hi> he compared the nature of the ſeed to a ſimple uniform circle, in which any man can neither find beginning or end, and that ſo far forth as it pertains to the varieties of corporeal parts
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:30788:40"/>
ſubſiſting in act in the ſeed. But ſurely the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> ſay this ſpirit having faculties and being the inſtrument of Nature frams three Jewels like pellucide drops of water in the midſt of the animal, which make imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately for themſelves certain Rudiments and beginnings of the three principal members, Heart, Liver, and Brain. They have not conſidered and marked the mechanical Lythargy of Generation, and the artificious adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſeed, neither have they underſtood the power of ſcience from which all things ariſe. But they have feigned corporeal Rudiments or beginnings of the parts in the ſeed, &amp; eſpecially of the principal members, which being ſeparated by the heat, at length they manifeſt and demonſtrate members whoſe beginnings they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his book <hi>de locis in homine,</hi> in the beginning hath Confirmed and Eſtabliſhed this his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſaying, that he found nothing in the body to which he might aſcribe beginning or ending, for if he deſcribed a circle, who can find beginning or ending? Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, ſeeing the nature of the ſeed is altogether ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and hath ſuch nutriment with it unto the matrices, we ought to imagine that there be diſſimilar parts in the ſeed, ſo that the body of the Brain ſhould be one, and the body of the Heart another, and the body of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver another, but we muſt think that this multitude of parts in the progreſs of time roſe from the ſame ſeed, and not from the maſs or multitude of bodies, but from the variety of the gifts, means, powers, and faculties in which the mechanical ſpirits excell. The faculty of the mechanical ſpirits is ſo great, that if they had the ſcience or faculty of the Heart, they would make and conform a heart from the attracted aliment, if of the Brain, they would make a Brain, if they had the faculty of the Liver, from the ſame aliment they would make a Liver, fleſh, veins, bones, ſinews, arteries, eyes, ears, and all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:30788:41"/>
which are needful for the conſtitution of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and this they would do in a right order and at ſet times. That is theperfect ſcience of the ſeeds and ſtars, full of power, which (they ſay) bear ſway in Nature, and all creatures confeſs the ſame. In this ſcience all ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures as well interiour as exteriour of the whole ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal are contained. This is the light of Nature, and the Predeſtination ſo often reiterated of <hi>Paracelſus.</hi> But now afterwards all the parts of the whole Animal ſhall be diſſolved and ſeparated in a legitimous and convenient order, more ſolid and abundant aliment is required, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do hidden paſſages ſuffice.</p>
                     <p>Again, the membranes waxing craſs and thick daily, in which the Child is wrapped, forthwith in theſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Aliment attracted is ſpiritual, even as all Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables and Minerals are nouriſhed with moſt ſubtile ſpirits, in which there is animal Balm agreeable to mans Nature. Hereupon aliment of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> is called ſeed; with which that of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> agrees, We are nouriſhed of the ſame from which we conſiſt. In this animal Balm are the Elements, and the three beginnings of bodies, Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, as we have demonſtrated in our Philoſophy. But here a moſt groſs untruth of the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> offers it ſelf unto our conſideration, namely, that they ſay that the young one is nouriſhed with <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi> in the mothers womb, which is the greateſt poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon Earth, when as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith in his third book <hi>de hiſtoria animalium, cap.</hi> 19. that that bloud which flows forth at ſet circuits in women is a kind of viciated and corrupted bloud, for by the benefit and work of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:30788:41"/>
Nature, (eſpecially the Moon decreaſing) is ſeparated from the purer bloud. This <hi>Menſtruum</hi> flowing forth, if a freſh Vine be toucht therewith it decays altogether, Fruits toucht therewith are made barren, Plants die, Herbs and Graſs in Gardens wither. If a pregnant tread upon the <hi>Menstruums</hi> of another woman, or if ſhe be ſprinkled with it, ſhe hath an untimely Birth. It alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether takes away the hope of conceiving from thoſe women which have not conceived already. The breath and vapours which come from the mouths of women purged of their <hi>Menſtruums</hi> obſcure and darken glaſſes, and brightneſs of Ivory. Mercury or Quickſilver which commonly is put in looking glaſſes with tinn, attracts through the glaſs poiſonful <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and the glaſs is not hurt, which appeareth if that the Quickſilver be ſhaved off the ſpot will appear no more in the glaſs. <hi>Greſs.</hi> Furthermore, if this bloud be taſted of a dog he becomes mad. This <hi>Menſtruum</hi> torments men with grievous pains, for it brings the falling ſickneſs, the falling of the hairs, and the Elephantiaſis, therefore it was counted amongſt the moſt grievous poiſons by the Ancient; hereupon it cometh to paſs, that in the woman in which it is ſuppreſſed that it flow not forth at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and ordinary time; unto her, which it ſhould be proper and benign, it brings divers incommodities and Diſeaſes, Namely, obſtructions of the bowels, pining, the cancer, the falling ſickneſs, and very many more mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Diſeaſes. Seing therefore that the annoiance and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity of it is ſo great, and the violence is ſo peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous, who will be ſo mad or ſottiſh to affirm that the young one hath nouriſhment from it in the womb? yea<note place="margin">All nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment is cauſed by Spirits, but yet by ſuch as of which bodies may be produced, which appears in things which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, where the Spirits are reſolved into the bodies, that there may be made increaſe.</note> then ſhe is wont to conceive beſt in the womb when ſhe is clenſed and purged from this filthy flux, and when
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:30788:42"/>
the bloud is pure where with the young ſhall be nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as likewiſe when the womb is clenſed. And though in the other time the vicious and pure are collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and do encreaſe together, for it is mixt with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pure and profitable bloud; yet notwithſtanding the young is not ſuſtained, nor liveth thereby, neither doth it attract it for nouriſhment, but only the ſweet and moſt pure bloud as far as it is able, but after the young is come to perfection and complement, and ſtands in need of more aboundant food, and ſuffereth not the ſpirits any longer to be included (all the bonds being burſt) it comes forth into the light of the World.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Galeniſts</hi> aſcribe the diſtinction of the Sex to the qualities by this reaſon, if that the ſeed of the Parents excell very much in heat and drineſs man will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created; on the contrary, if cold and moiſtneſs domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer woman will be procreated. But profeſs both the Sexes to be contained in one Root and vital Principle; the mixtions and tinctures ſuperadded mans ſtrength may degenerate into womans weakneſs and facility of bringing forth, ſo that woman is nothing elſe but a Tranſplanted man, not as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirmed, that ſhe was a monſter riſing from Tranſplantation. But we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that this Tranſplantation is neceſſary and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by the Laws of Nature, wherefore this Tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is not to be aſcribed to heat or cold, but to the ſuperadded tinctures of mixtion, which ſuperadded tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures we will largely explain in the differences of Tranſplantations. And theſe concerning the Generation of perfect animals which have obtained ſtrong and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful ſeed, which will endure for an age, howſoever it be agitated and toſſed with divers mutations of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplantation. But here we had almoſt forgot the ſubtilty of the <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> which ſay that the young in the womb hath the faculty of ſenſe about the 36 day. I marvel
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:30788:42"/>
who of them hath peirced into the ſecret Cloſets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? or who of them hath obſerved at what time the young one receiveth ſenſe in the womb? If that they ſay they found it by anatomy, it is falſe, for the young can live no longer when the mother dies. If they object and ſay that the mothers obſerved it, I ask of them by what means, and how? Certainly, if they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the ſciences and powers of the ſeeds, they would never have alleged and brought in ſuch old wives Fables. But that which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> profeſſeth that the male his bones being ſtrengthned and made ſomewhat harder moves in the third moneth, but the woman in the fourth, we likewiſe grant this, for the pregnant may obſerve the firſt leaping of the Child, and perceiveth it as the tickling of a flie.</p>
                     <p>Imperfect animals are thoſe which generate without a manifeſt putting forth of ſeed, as Eels, Frogs, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all inſected animals by their mutual embracings do ſend forth the flowr of Balm into the Matrices and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles for Generation wherein all things are abſolved and perfected which are needful and neceſſary to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Again, they profuſe or pour forth a fruitful ſeed which is craſs and clammy reſiſting external injuries, which ſeed is ſtirred up and compelled to work by the benefit of the heat of the Sun, and then it conſtitutes the Elements, and adjoyneth ſuch like Principles of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and perfects the offices of mixtion, which things being perfected it abſolveth and finiſheth the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration correſpondent to the ſcience of the mechanical ſpirits. In the procreation of fiſhes, when as the female hath laid down her Eggs, the male comes and ſprinkles his ſeed upon the Eggs, and how many ſoever have been ſprinkled with his ſeed take life, the reſt which are fruſtrate and deſtitute of the heat of the male do pine away and corrupt. There is the ſame reaſon of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:30788:43"/>
Generation of birds which bring forth Eggs in the place of ſeed, and then they keep them warm by their heat, and ſo bring forth young birds. The Generation by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction which the Philoſophers call the Generation from ſeed and from putrefaction, differs from this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Generation.</p>
                     <p>The Generation by putrefaction is of that kind which the Generation of mice and bees is, which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> calls Generation <hi>ex cagaſtro;</hi> ſo worms are generated in cheeſe and hornets in the excrements of horſes. But concerning thoſe animals which do make congreſs and generate with animals of divers kinds, as the Horſe and the Aſs, the Wolf and the Dog, we will handle of them in the difference of Tranſplantations.</p>
                     <p>This Generation of Animals differs from the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vegetables, becauſe the ſeeds of animals neither do voluntarily riſe out of the Earth, nor are ſubmitted by the induſtry and labour of man, but the ſeeds having attained a fit matrix they proceed unto the Generation of perfect Animals, where they perfect the animals com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementally.</p>
                     <p>The Laws and Foundations of Generations and Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being demonſtrated, and the ſpiritual beginnings of Generations being explained, and alſo the manners and differences of the Generations of Vegetables, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, and Animals, being adduced and inferred, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth that we handle of Tranſplantation ſuperadded to Generation, which happeneth to all the orders of Generation; for thoſe which put the light of Generation and Tranſplantation before things unknown in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and the art of Medicines, the difference being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, they prepare for us not any paſſage and entrance unto any vulgar Philoſophy and art of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine inſiſting in qualities, but unto Philoſophy ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Laws of Nature. Certainly none can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:30788:43"/>
the death of things, and the diſſolution of the Soul from the Body, which knows not throughly this difference, and if he know not the death of things and the diſſolution of the Soul from the Body, that Phyſician will never attain unto the preparations of medicines; for how ſhall he ſeparate things from life, which hath neither known life nor death, and attributes the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of life unto dead things? what ſhall I ſay of the knowledge of Diſeaſes? Thoſe which abſolve this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence by qualities will never ſee how death comes to life, or how by the Laws of Nature the diſſolution of the Soul and Body happens.</p>
                     <p>But that we may come to the matter, we ſay that Tranſplantation is a ſymptom of Generation, but this is not to be underſtood in general of every Tranſplanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but in particular: for Tranſplantation is conſidered<note place="margin">Tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is twofold.</note> two ways; for either it is ſubject to the will of man, or it depends of Nature alone.</p>
                     <p>That which is ſubject to the induſtry and labour of man is perfected either by ſeed or cutting. In this Tranſplantation whether it be effected by material ſeeds or inciſion, two things are to be conſidered, Times and Place.</p>
                     <p>It is behoveful to obſerve times in the Tranſplantation which is to be perfected by the miniſtery of hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are defined and ſet Periods in which the force of the ſeminal flowr appears in Plants and Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, for unleſs the flouriſhing and vigour of the flowr were tranſplanted by the time all labour were fruſtrate and Generation were in vain. So ſome material ſeeds of Plants have their flouriſhings and vigour of the ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal flowr in the beginning of the Spring, ſome in the midſt, ſome in the end, ſome in Summer, ſome in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn. There is the ſame reaſon of trees, which alſo have divers times of their flouriſhing and ſeminal vigour
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:30788:44"/>
of the matter, as the Quince-tree and the Damſin-trees are tranſplanted very ſeaſonably after Winter, the Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-trees and Almond-trees about Winter, Mulberry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees before the Springs Equinoctial.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo convenient that there be places fit for the Tranſplantations done by mans labour, for except theſe ſubjects of mans Tranſplantations ſhall find a fit matrix, the Tranſplantation will be fruſtrate and in vain, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be done by inciſion or by ſeed. Therefore it is behoveful to obſerve ſuch places in our Tranſplantations as Nature affecteth, and in which places Nature will bring forth freely and planteouſly fruits of this or that kind; for every ground doth not bring forth all fruits, ſome fruits Spring pleaſantly in funny places, ſome in ſhadowed places, which Nature he obſerveth thus, ſuch like and ſuch Plants being tranſplanted, our Ladies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloves love little, Hillocks, the Poplar, the Willows, and Arſemart love the Waters, and Mercuries Fingers and Melilot as we have explained in the Generation of Vegetables. We will apply this firſt Generation of Tranſplantation fitly in the difference of the Generation of Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>The other kind of Tranſplantation is that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Nature alone, or it is that which is cauſed by the more effective tinctures of the Elements, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ſubject to mans ſenſe. For the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this Tranſplantation, it is behoveful to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the roots or tinctures of things which help both for Generation and Tranſplantation, though the roots or effective tinctures, the efficient cauſes of Tranſplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have not been explained at any time of any Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, but they have adumbrated or over-ſhadowed them by figures, metaphors, and allegories. And theſe tinctures are twofold, either perfect and firſt, or elſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and ſuperadded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:30788:44"/>The perfect and firſt Roots of things are Stars, Seeds, Roots of Tranſplantations, and of the Philoſophers they are called the tinctures of the Elements. The ſeeds or roots of Tranſplantation ſhew the cauſe of death and diſſolution. The ſeeds or ſtars of Generation are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained both in Philoſophy and in the difference of the Generation of natural things; now we will handle of the Stars, Seeds, and Roots of Tranſplantation. For we ſay that every Generation by the ſuperadded Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplantation is removed and diſplaced from the degree of dignity, whereby the Seeds, Stars, and Roots of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration are leſſe able to manifeſt their gifts and in-bred ſciences; for every tranſplanted Generation, (that is) Tranſplantation of ſpirits, doth not change unto the better, but unto worſe; and the properties and gifts of every tranſplanted Generation, (namely of the ſpirits) are much weakned by the ſuperadded impreſſions and concurring Stars of Tranſplantation. The tinctures of the Elements, Stars, Seeds, and Roots of Tranſplanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Impreſſions which cauſe Tranſplantation, are the Being or Eſſence of poiſon, which eſpecially is found forth and appeareth in Minerals, as in Arſenick, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, Vitriol, Mercury, Antimony, and in Saturn. In Vegetables as the Nettle, Woolf-bane, Hemlock, and the Poppy. But it is circumſpectly to be obſerved, that Tranſplantation in regard of the tinctures is twofold namely, the univerſal and the particular.</p>
                     <p>The univerſal Tranſplantation is that which extends together unto all natural things by Gods curſe, for there is nothing free from Tranſplantation in the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, but it hath impurities admixt and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned unto the veins, gueſts, and tinctures of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and unto the Stars, Seeds, and Roots of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplantation; for the Stars themſelves (as <hi>Job</hi> witneſſeth) are not free from this Tranſplantation; neither Gold,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:30788:45"/>
Silver, or Gemms are excepted from this Tranſplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on though they ſeem to carry an anatomy of ſoundneſs or purity. <hi>Paracelſus (in Chirurgiamajore 2 Book cap.</hi> 8. of his 3 Tractate) ſaith, that Gold by his Nature hath Realgar, or being of poiſon, which is ſeparated from her by <hi>Antimony;</hi> for if that Gold wanted Realgar or poiſon (as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſpeaks) the Spagirical Philoſophers would not ſo ſtrictly command that before the preparation of potable Gold that the body of Gold ſhould be ſeparated from poiſon and impurities. So amongſt Vegetables every body hath poiſon, and thoſe which be called ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of Phyſicians. That Vegetable which cannot be rightly ſeparated neither by artificial or natural concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ventricle, is the cauſe of many moſt grievous Diſeaſes. Whereupon with <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and other true Phyſicians this being of poiſon is celebrated to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the moſt noble amongſt other beings of Diſeaſes. Of which being of poiſon, and more common cauſe of Diſeaſes we will more largely handle in the differences concerning the Generation of Diſeaſes. This general Tranſplantation contains in it a ſpiritual Tranſplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in regard of the tinctures which bear ſway in all the Elements.</p>
                     <p>The ſpiritual Tranſplantation is twofold. The firſt is the Tranſplantation of Individuals. The ſecond is of the kinds.</p>
                     <p>The Tranſplantation of the Individuals is in which the utmoſt Signatures are only changed, as Colours, Smells, Taſtes, Magnitude, Figure, &amp;c. yet this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplantation is not to be read ſo, that it be not made with the ſuperadded tinctures of the Elements, but by Seeds, Stars, and Roots of the ſame kind, as Vegetables with Vegetables, Minerals with Minerals, &amp;c. Seeing there be many ſeeds in Vegetables, in which the Sciences and predeſtnated gifts of many Individuals are conjoyned,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30788:45"/>
which by the judgment of the ſenſe do ſeem to differ in ſome ſort in kind, it is no marvel if that they paſs into new Familes by a light moment; <hi>Severinus</hi> p. 141. as if Watercreſſes be tranſplanted into Mint, Rape into Radiſh, the herb <hi>Imperatoria</hi> into <hi>Angelica.</hi> This Tranſplantation is neither to be aſcribed to the tinctures of the Elements, nor being of Poiſon, but to the Star, Seed, or Root of Mint, Radiſh, Angelica, and to the Roots of Watercreſſes, Rape, and the herb <hi>Imperatoria,</hi> by the perfect mixtion of the Individuals ſuperadded. In this Tranſplantation the power of the Root, and his family or kind, remaineth, and ſheweth certain ſigns, though it be very much changed.</p>
                     <p>The Generation of Gemms is a Tranſplantation of this kind, which are produced from the firſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Root of Metalls, the Stars, Seeds, or Roots ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added and concurring. So from the Roots of Lead the Adamant is tranſplanted, from the Roots of Gold is the <hi>Saphirus</hi> tranſplanted, from the Roots of Copper is the <hi>Smaragdus</hi> tranſplanted, from the Roots of Iron is <hi>Berill</hi> tranſplanted, &amp;c. Thoſe which are ſpoke of the Stars, Seeds, and Roots of Tranſplantation, namely, thoſe which manifeſt the anatomy of death and diſſolution, are not to be underſtood of the Tranſplantation of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, but of the general Tranſplantation and of the kinds; nevertheleſs the general Tranſplantation is alſo to be referred unto the Tranſplantation of Individuals; for no natural body (or which is produced of four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) wants impurities or being of poiſon. The Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplantation of perfect animals pertains alſo unto this Tranſplantation of Individuals, for it is above ſaid that a woman is a tranſplanted man: for in the Generation of perfect animals, if the Star, Seed, and tincture of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> concur, and be indued with a ſtrong power, all the ſeed ſhall be adorned with properties and parts
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30788:46"/>
in the <hi>Menſtruum.</hi> If that the Star or Seed of the Male ſhall domineer it produces the Male, and mans Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. But here an Inquiſition may be made, how it comes to paſs how <hi>Hermophradites</hi> are generated, having both Male and Female members. The anſwer is, that if the Stars and Seeds of the Male as well as of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> ſhall be equal in vertue, in the mechanical proceſs of Generation <hi>Hermophradites</hi> are generated; for that ſeed or ſtar doth ſometime predominate, and hath the nature of the one; forthwith it abounds with propenſion to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get man, forthwith to beget woman.</p>
                     <p>That Tranſplantation which riſes from the congreſs of animals of divers kinds is often barren, neither can there be a natural Tranſplantation unleſs their ſeeds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire with exceeding great Society and Conſent, for ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals do difficultly admit Tranſplantation, which are ſeparated by the perfect diſtinction of the Sex. Hither is referred the Generation of Minerals, which hath (as a Companion of Generation) Tranſplantation adjoyned nigh the nature of an <hi>Hermophradite</hi> with Balm. The Fruits of the ſuperiour Globe are alſo obnoxious to this Tranſplantation, and that if they be perfected at the ſame time, and have conſpired by the Society of the beams, as Snow and Rain, and there are made Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplantations of the bodies of the Fruits, namely the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the bodies being altered by violence, frequency, aboundance, and diuturnity.</p>
                     <p>The Tranſplantation of the kind is where not only the external ſignatures, but alſo the internal are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and thereby the Root and Firſt Matter. This Tranſplantation proceeds from moſt valid and effective tinctures, and only adheres to the Individuals of things, (that is) to the beginnings of bodies. Again, it hath poſſeſt the very Root of the thing, ſo that there is no further hope that theſe firſt Tranſplantations may be
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:30788:46"/>
mended. The tinctures of the Elements are proper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Tranſplantation, and it differs in nothing from the general Tranſplantation of things, but that the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplantation of the kind may be cauſed by more valid and effective tinctures of the Elements, but the general Tranſplantation is cauſed by more light tinctures.</p>
                     <p>The Tranſplantation of the kind and mutation of the Root appears in the Tare and in the Darnel, in which Tranſplantation the Root of the Wheat is tranſplanted by the tinctures of the Elements into a calamitous chance. Hither pertains Antimony and <hi>Anarchiſite, Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna.</hi> It is to be obſerved, that thoſe tinctures of the Elements are not altogether diſagreeable from the thing to whom they are ſuperadded, but in ſome ſort they conſpire with them, though they endeavour for diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and make divers deceits againſt life; for if they had not ſome affinity with the Roots, Stars, and Firſt Matter of things, they could not be mixed, and ſo the Counſel and intent, not only of Generation, but alſo of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplantation ſhall be anihilated and fruſtrate.</p>

                     <p>THe Elements are twofold; Spiritual, as Fire and Air, and Corporal, as Water and Earth. Of theſe all natural things are compounded, and are reſolved into them again; and from theſe they do not only receive life and being, but alſo they receive nouriſhment from them for the conſervation of life; wherefore it is truly ſaid of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> We are nouriſhed by the ſame of which we are compounded, though not actually yet po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially: for all our aliment which we receive from the Elements is conveyed to the mechanical ſpirits of our bodies, by which it is tranſmutated into the ſubſtance of our Balſam.</p>
                     <p>Nutriment is twofold by reaſon of the Elements; Spiritual and Corporal. The Fire and the Air do yield
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:30788:48"/>
us ſpiritual nouriſhment; The Water and the Earth yield us Corporal. This nutriment, whether it be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or corporal, contains in it three Principles and animal Balſam: for the bodies of all the Elements con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury.</p>
                     <p>Our firſt-begot ſpirit, or in-bred heat, or vital Balſam uſeth this ſpiritual aliment, and it requires the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and fruits of the Celeſtial and Aery ſeeds, which are conjoyned by great neceſſity; and this ſpirit doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive alteration and refrigeration from this aliment, but Subſtance, Body, and Nutriment, yet ſuch as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable unto it.</p>
                     <p>In the Doctrine of Tranſplantation we have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that in all the Elements and firſt pure ſeeds of things there are permixt and implanted tinctures, or roots, or ſtars, the Authors of Tranſplantations, which induce and bring the anatomy of Diſeaſes and Death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Common-wealth of life; whatſoever therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth and ſucketh life and aliments from the Elements, doth therewith receive Diſeaſes, for all aliments are ſeeds, but yet permixt with impurities.</p>
                     <p>From theſe we collect that there are four ſtars or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Health in the Elements, ſo alſo ſtars or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Diſeaſes lurk and are cloſely contained in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

                     <p>The ſtars of the Firmament which are the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect bodies, and are repreſented by a viſible form, are contained in the other Elements in vertue and vital power: for we ſee the Golden chain of <hi>Homer</hi> and the Society of the inviſible nature with the viſible, and we deprehend it in the conſpiration of the ſtars as well of Health as of Diſeaſes.</p>

Theſe five Beings are five Originals or Cauſes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, of which Cauſes every one hath full and perfect power of procreating all Diſeaſes; ſo that according to the Beings or Cauſes, there are five kinds of the Plague, five kinds of the Dropſie, five of the Jaundies, five kinds of Fevers, and ſo of every Diſeaſe there are five kinds, and not one kind of every Diſeaſe as Phyſicians have faſly perſwaded themſelves hitherto, ſeeing that every Being is able to engender all the Diſeaſes; and as in the inferiour Globe of Water and Earth we ſee the fruits which generate the Stone, the Tartar, the Sand, the Gout, the Pining, and the Dropſie; ſo in the ſuperiour
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:30788:49"/>
Globe ſome ſtars have the ſame Properties and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting tinctures, and ſeeds of Diſeaſes, and are able to produce all Diſeaſes; which thing <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus</hi> the Father of the firſt ſacred Philoſophy teſtifies, when as he ſaith, It is true and no lie, it is certain and moſt true, that that which is below is as that which is above, and that which is above is as that which is below. This ſaying of <hi>Hermes</hi> is not only to be underſtood of the Conſpiration and Harmony, or Conflux and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Firſt and uncorrupted Matter, or of the ſtars of Generation in both the Globes, but alſo of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the ſuperadded tinctures and ſtars of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplantation.</p>
                     <p>The Holy Ghoſt confirms this <hi>Hermes</hi> his concord of the ſuperiour and inferiour things, and as well of the firſt perfect Nature as of the corruptible and ſuperadded Nature, by <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Apocalyp.</hi> where it is writ, that<note place="margin">Apoc. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So alſo the properties of <hi>Arſenick, Colocynthis, Devils Milk,</hi> and <hi>Scammony,</hi> and all the properties of things and of ſuperadded tinctures (according to the ſentence of <hi>Hermes,</hi> and Doctrine of the holy Ghoſt) are found to be in the ſuperiour Globe and viſible ſtars, which properties are hidden in the bodies of the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Globe. We were ever happy Aſtronomers, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, and Phyſicians, if we knew that concordance of <hi>Hermes,</hi> then we could truly interpret that which God ſpake by <hi>Moſes,</hi> That they were for ſigns, which thing we ſee with half ſhut eyes, theſe Concordances being not known.</p>
                     <p>Certainly many Phyſicians do neither believe nor do grant that from the ſtars of the four Elements, as from
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:30788:50"/>
univerſal cauſes of all Diſeaſes as well ſpiritual as mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, acute as chronical, all Diſeaſes do riſe, ſeeing that the ſtars are ſuch clear, beautiful, and lucid bodies which do abſolve and finiſh a certain Courſe.</p>
                     <p>From hence it appears that they only read the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Heathen, and that they have loſt the great book of Nature, and the book of Philoſophy, and art of Phyſick, and that they have not read the Bible, from which as from a Fountain all Wiſdom floweth; for if they had read the Bible with judgment they would have found it in expreſs words writ in <hi>Job,</hi> that the ſtars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God are not pure, but contaminated with impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and tinctures ſuperadded; wherefore as the Earth for the fall and prevarication of the firſt man was Curſed and filled with thorns and briers, even ſo the ſuperior bodies the like ſpiritually, which the inferiours receive corporally, which <hi>Hermes</hi> and all real Aſtrologers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Experience, do affirm.</p>

                     <p>SEeing that in the viſible ſtars of the Firmament there are found not onely the form of the Wheat, but of Darnel, and not only the Nature and Properties of Gold and Silver, Balmmint and Roſe, but of <hi>Arſenick,</hi> Woofsbane, and Poppy, it follows neceſſarily, that the Being of Poiſon is contained in the Being of the ſtars, though it differ from the being of poiſon in the inferiour bodies, becauſe it is in the ſtars ſpiritually, but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour bodies corporally: for <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in his book <hi>de ente Aſtr. cap.</hi> 9. writes, that there do not more poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons exiſt in the Earth than do in the ſtars, when as he ſays, all the kinds of poiſons which the fruits of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Globe of the Earth and Water do ſhew unto us,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:30788:50"/>
are likewiſe contained the ſtars of the Firmament. And furthermore he ſaith of thoſe exalted ſtars poiſoned with impurities and reſolved ſeeds, that they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all Diſeaſes which theſe inferiour bodies by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their poiſon can produce; for the original and cauſe of all Diſeaſes is the being of poiſon, and all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes are generated from poiſon. Wherefore Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans perſwade themſelves that all Diſeaſes as well ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual as corporal have their original and beginning from the ſpiritual or corporal being of poiſon. The being of poiſon is rightly diſtinguiſhed for the difference of the ſuperiour and inferiour bodies into the ſpiritual in regard of the ſuperiour and corporal in regard of the inferiour bodies.</p>
                     <p>We have ſaid in our Philoſophy, that no Element doth bring forth fruits in his own proper place, but in a ſtrange place, and that the fruits of the Firmament were abſolved and perfected in the Air; for as the fruits of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity flowing from the Firmament are abſolved in the Air, ſo alſo the ſtars of the Firmament do lay down the fruits of Diſeaſes and Death in the boſom of the air, that there they may attain the predeſtinated term and perfection. But ſeeing that the neceſſity of the air is ſo great to all living creatures that they cannot want it for a moment, It comes to paſs, that not only brute Animals do attract corrupt and infected air by breathing, but alſo men; for the aliment of the Microcoſm as of the ſuperiour Globe is altogether inviſible and ſpiritual. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his book <hi>de flatibus,</hi> ſhews the unreſiſtible neceſſity of this aliment. The neceſſity of breathing is ſo great to all mortal creatures, that though man abſtain from all other things, ſo that he neither eat, nor drink, yet he may live two or three days or moe: but if any man have the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages ſtopped by which breath enters into the body, he dies in leſs than a moment of an hour. Again, men
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:30788:51"/>
may ceaſe from other labours, but there is no reſt or ceaſing from breathing granted to any. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in his book <hi>de ente Astror. cap.</hi> 7. calls the Air a great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, but yet for ſome analogy or ſimilitude, for by the air he underſtands the ſtars of the air which give life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all things. And it is truly ſaid of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in the ſame Treatiſe, <hi>cap.</hi> 7. that all bodies and Elements are preſerved by the air; but not by the air alone, but by ſeeds and ſtars; for all aliments and nutriments are ſeeds, but mixt with impurities. Neither is the air a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone as far as it is an Element infected with poiſonſome properties, but that great Myſtery from the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the poiſonful tinctures is Tranſplanted and tranſmutated, which gives aliment to the vital Balm. So that this aliment being received, and the great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery being Tranſplanted and tranſmutated, the animal and vital Balm is alſo infected, whereupon follows the Tranſplantation of the body into a calamitous chance. Although this aliment be inviſible and want external ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures (by which they make differences of the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the inferiour Globe) as Taſte, Solidneſs, Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Tenuity, Clammineſs, Heat, Eaſie or Hard Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; yet it is not deſtitute of the interiour ſignatures; for the ſpirits and reſolutions of fruits of the ſuperiour Globe are neither ſweet nor ſowr, bitter nor ſharp, white nor black, and very often admit or receive ſtinking ſmells. In this aliment four qualities as the qualities or faculties of ſome poiſons exiſt and triumph, which neither by taſte nor ſmell, or any manifeſt qualities ſhew and manifeſt their occult qualities. But pernicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions are onely deprehended and known from the affects.</p>

                     <p>IF the inferiour bodies be as the ſuperiour, which is confirmed by the Teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt and of <hi>Hermes,</hi> then all the ſtars in the Firmament do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in them the anatomy of Diſeaſes and Death; but many are found forth whoſe reſolutions are wholſome; for in the inferiour Globe Nature hath ſet before our eyes Gold, Silver, Gemms, Balmmint, Roſes, Violets, Betony, Wheat, Barley, Wine, Milk, withall which Nature refreſhes the vital ſpirits continually as with food and aliment. Again, we ſee the herbs and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camental ſimple bodies, Lettice, Caſſia, Rheubarb, Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pody or Oakfern, Vinegar, Agarick, the herb Trinity, Arſemart, Cuckowpitle, and others of that kind. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſome do ſhew poiſon manifeſtly, as Arſenick, Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane, Poppy, Hemlock, Antimony, Vittiol, Mercury, Scammony, Devils Milk, Colocynth, all which reſiſt mans Nature, and intend preſent death.</p>
                     <p>As the inferiour Globle yields unto us three Orders of all fruits of the Earth and Water common to things and kinds, namely, that ſome are wholſome unto men and neceſſary for life, as is ſaid of Wheat and Wine; Some are indifferent and mean, as is ſaid of Caſſia, of Lettice, Polypody, and Rheubarb; Some are altogether contrary to mans Nature, as Arſenick, Hemlock, Woolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane: Even ſo we diſtinguiſh all the ſtars in the viſible Heaven into three Orders. Firſt, ſome ſtars have the anatomy of Soundneſs, whoſe reſolutions are neceſſary for the health of Animals, and they have alſo the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere conditions of Nutriment; neither is there any poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonful property found in them by ſenſe or effect. Theſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:30788:52"/>
ſtars anſwer in the inferiour Globe to Gold, Silver, Gemms, Balmmint, Roſe, Wheat, Wine, Milk. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſome ſtars have tinctures and medicamental properties, but yet lighter admixt in their exaltations and their reſolutions which riſe at the ſeveral times of the year, and are frequent. Theſe ſtars in the inferiour Globe agree with Lettice, Caſſia, Cuckowpintle, Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mart, Agarick, and others of this kind. Thirdly, ſome ſtars in the reſolutions of the ſeeds ſhew the poiſonful properties of Arſenick, Auripigmentum, Sulphur, Woolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane, Libberdsbane, by manifeſt teſtimonies of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Theſe ſtars in the inferiour ſphere have theſe nigh and of affinity with them; namely, Mercury, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, Arſenick, Sulphur, Woolfbane, Scammony, Ellebor, the herb Devils Milk, Colocynth, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>From theſe it is manifeſt that natural things and fruits of the Elements, as well of the ſuperiour as of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſphere, are divided into three Orders.

                     <p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:30788:52"/>The firſt of all we muſt conſider which Planets are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign, which are malicious and hurtful, and this of erring ſtars.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the fixt ſtars, we have diſtributed them into ſeven Orders, <hi>cap.</hi> 1. of this Treatiſe, and that in regard of the Planets and dominant ſtars to whom the fixt ſtars do (as it were) ſerve and imitate the Nature of their dominant Planets.</p>
                     <p>That the benignity and clemency, as on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the malignity of the Planets might be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, we have divided the erring Stars or Planets into two kinds, The clement or benign, and the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                     <p>The benign or clement Planets are the <hi>Sun, Jupiter, Venus, Mercurius,</hi> The malicious or malignant are <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> The indifferent Planet is the <hi>Moon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the ſame manner the ſigns of the Zodiack are to be explained, which the Planets or erring Stars illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and illuminate, and for the Nature of the gueſts, the Houſes or Gueſthouſes are made friendly or malignant. Notwithſtanding for the moſt part they ſhew and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their malice in their proper houſes, as <hi>Saturn</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarius, Capricorn</hi> and <hi>Libra,</hi> which is the houſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation. So <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Aries, Scorpio</hi> and in <hi>Capricorn,</hi> which is the houſe of exaltation. It is to be obſerved, that there are four triplicities of the Stars in the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack, and there are three ſigns attributed to every Planet, which are indued either with good or malignant quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by reaſon of the quality of their Planet.</p>
                     <p>Again, thoſe ſigns in the Zodiack are twofold in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Elements. Some are fiery and aery; Some watery and earthly. <hi>Saturn</hi> hath a triplicity in the fiery and aery ſigns; <hi>Mars</hi> in the watery and earthly ſigns; ſo that <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> are thought to comprehend the whole neceſſity of things by their malignity; for the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:30788:53"/>
                        <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> (which otherwiſe are numbred amongſt the benign and mild Planets) when they are in the ends of <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> they are made partakers of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, ſo that they are deprived of their good and friendly Nature unto men, and take upon them the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly Nature and malignant to their inſeriours, for theſe ſigns which are very much Saturnal, and too much Martial, are hurtful and unfriendly ſpirits naturally to the ſpirit; ſo that we ſay the Signs or Planets are infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and contrary to mans Nature by <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> unleſs they be in their Houſes or Kingdoms (that is) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when they are there, or have their Aſpect thither either in Oppoſite or Quadrate. We call the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Aſpect that which is betwixt thoſe which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant very far amongſt themſelves. We call the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate Aſpect that when as one is diſtant from another the fourth part of the Heaven, (that is) it is diſtant the third ſpace of the ſigns, and then the confluence doth ſomewhat mitigate the malice of <hi>Mars;</hi> ſo <hi>Jupiter</hi> doth temperate the malignity of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and bruiſes his poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonful glaſs. The Aſpect of <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Mars</hi> unto the <hi>Moon</hi> exiſts every where ill and malignant. And thus much of the Nature, Property, and Difference of the erring ſtars. Now concerning the fixt ſtars, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the ſigns.

                        </gap>s conſidered by themſelves into two Orders, and we have comprehended the indifferent and mean under the benign and mild ſtars by reaſon of the general Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplantation which happeneth equally to all created things of the ſuperiour and inferiour Globe. In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Chap. concerning the ſpiritual Tranſplantation of the ſtars, we have handled and demonſtrated which ſtars did excel others in malice and malignity, whoſe beginnings and reſolutions are firſt of all to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for all Diſeaſes which the inferiour Globe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates may likewiſe be produced of the ſuperiour. In the inferiour Globe and fruits of the Elements of Water and Earth, we can eſchew and flie thoſe things which are extreme hurtful and noxious, as far as they are known to us. But we can no way flie the Aſtral impreſſion and infected Air, but without diſcerning we attract as well the hurtful and infected air, as the wholſome, by inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and inward breathing, and we uſe it for neceſſity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing it is inviſible and deſtitute of exteriour ſignatures. Furthermore, when the Conſtellation, Influence, or
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:30788:54"/>
Aſtral impreſſion ariſeth from the courſe of the ſtars, or unlucky and unfortunate placing and contrary motion thereof, or from the Aſpects of the Planets, as alſo the Malevolent and malignant ſtars have made reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the fruits in the air, and have imitated the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſuperiour Globe in their ſignatures, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto the poiſonful properties of the ſtars; and when the material ſtars riſe with the poiſonful properties of Arſenick, or when Arſenicks properties or Realgar of the Planets are begot by the malignant and infortunate poſiture or conjunction, then the plague is cauſed. But when the properties of Saturn, Ellebor, Colocynth, Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and Devils Milk, have dominion in the air, they produce the diſſolute Diſeaſe, and the Dyſentety; for whatſoever the beams of the ſtars touch, that they change altogether, and indue the nutriment of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Globe with poiſonful properties, which men attract by breathing. And this is the engendring of the Plague, Dyſentery, Out-raging, Madneſs, Epilepſie, Gout, and of all Aſtral Diſeaſes; for there is the ſame reaſon of the indifferent or mean ſtars, which produce lighter Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as Fevers, Rheums, Horrours, Diſuria, Pandicula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sloth, Drowſineſs, difficulties of breathing.</p>

But perchance ſome will object, feeing that the being of poiſon is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſpiritually by inſpiring, wherefore is not the whole body but ſome part, and not the heart but ſome other more principal Members tranſmutated? It is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the common ſentence of Philoſophers, that Nature rejoyces for Nature, and Nature receives that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:30788:54"/>
Nature which it meets with; verily in man all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and ſtars of the Heaven and Earth are contained, and for this cauſe man is called a Microcoſm, though they ſhew the contrary; but yet he is ſo by reaſon of the like effects, as <hi>Libavius</hi> could not deny; for there are not only bad properties in man but good, as the form of Darnel lies cloſely in the ſeed of the Wheat. Therefore like do congratulate with like, and good properties do ever yield to the more ſtrong, when as bad are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added, as the form of Wheat yieldeth and granteth the Empire to bad properties, the tinctures of the Lilly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuperadded. Theſe Tranſplantations are frequent in the Generation and in the Curing of Diſeaſes. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly when the temperature of the bad properties and not of the firſt or ſecond qualities (of which, <hi>Galen,</hi> diſtemperature riſes) excelleth, and receiveth more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment from inordinate and bad diet, or from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the ſtars, the natural actions of the Members are hurt, weakned, hindred, or altogether extinguiſhed, from whence it is a true ſaying, As many Members as many Deaths. When a Phyſician helpeth diſeaſed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the like Remedies fetcht from the ſigned art and anatomy, the temperature of the bad properties is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, and the Empire and Dominion of Nature is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</p>
                     <p>And this is the true and proper Theory of the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Cure of Diſeaſes. That we may return unto our purpoſe, and propound more clearly the anatomy of aſtral Diſeaſes, we will demonſtrate this anatomy by an example of the Dyſentery.</p>
                     <p>The poiſon of the Dyſentery is of the Nature of the fiery impreſſion, and the inteſtines of man have the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. Furthermore, the inteſtines receive that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

ſtance of the inteſtines, as the form of the Darnel in the Wheat; which properties of the inteſtines being malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and ſtrengthned in the Period of Evacuations expel Nature, untill that after the avoiding and ejection of all the Excrements and Humours the faculties be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coriated, and ſo they expel and eject the blood, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pieces of fleſh, yea the very ſubſtance of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines.</p>
                     <p>So likewiſe the Brain hath his ſtars, which if they be rightly tempered in the Macrocoſm, the Brain i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This is the anatomy of the Places and the Planets which firſt of all are to be obſerved and underſtood of a Phyſician. Of which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in the 4. Chap. <hi>de duplici anatomia.</hi> This I count the chief and eſpecial thing in a Phyſician, that he rightly underſtand the confluence of anatomy, and by what means Places and Diſeaſes do agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, not that it ought to be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the exteriour anatomy of the Macrocoſm, but rather that it be deduced by the ſame influence.</p>

It is moſt truly ſaid of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> that conſervation is continued by nutrition; for they are called the greater after a Philoſophical manner, which excel in more forcible impreſſions and tinctures; and they are called the leſs or weaker which yield in the mixtion and conſpiration of the beams, and grant the ſeparations, alterations, and tranſmutations of their parts to the diſpoſing and wills of the more potent and ſtrong. The fecundity and fruitfulneſs of whole Nature is Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and Confirmed by the mutual conſpiration of both the Firmaments or Heavens, and by their familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and nutrition; by the reciprocal courſe of the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the knot or bond of health is conſerved, the Laws of theſe being corrupted, barrenneſs, defects and moſt grievous diſeaſes do follow in mans Nature.</p>
                     <p>Some things were ſee in the VVorlds Aſtronomy, as the riſing of Stars at certain ſeaſons defend and conſerve the wholſomeneſs of the year for the ſeaſonable reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of fruits, forthwith the ſtars of Rain bringing more commodiouſly reſolution are required.

                     <p>THe being of Poiſon which is in all aliments is an excrementitious and Tartareous impurity, which hath not an expulſive vertue, but rather a conſtipating Alumiſh and aſtringent faculty.</p>
                     <p>After that the ſtomach hath received, eaten and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted meats, it ſeparates the pure from the impure. The pure nutriment is, if that the Ventricle be ſtrong the pure aliment paſſes to the members for nutriment, the impure is evacuated by ſtool. If the Ventricle be weak it ſends the impure unto the Liver, and there ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is made; if that the Liver be ſtrong it ſeparates well and ſends the excrementitious matter together with the Urine; if there be a good ſeparation it is well, if not, the excrementitious and ſtony matter remains and is coagulated into a ſand which is called a Tartar. The original and Fountain of this evil muſt be diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, from whence many diſeaſes of the great inferiour Globe do riſe. The original and Fountain of them is the ſtomach, which hath the properties of three begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings flowing together with the ſpirits of the foreſaid Alumiſh conſtipating and ſowr Tartareous filth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements.</p>

                     <p>IT is often ſaid that all aliments are ſeeds, but yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt with impurities. Theſe ſeeds are contained in three Beginnings which have their excrements, for in Sulphur there is a fat and ſmoaky excrement, in Salt a foul Earth, in Mercury there is phlegm. Hereupon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers diſeaſes are begot in mans body for the diverſity of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:30788:61"/>
places if they be not rightly ſeparated by the mechanical ſpirits of the bowels ſerving for nouriſhment, nor be expelled by the emunctory or avoiding and accuſtomed places. Seeing therefore ſuch like impurities of the three principles flow in the body, becauſe they have not a conſpiration in the body, but expel the vital Sulphurs from their Globes unleſs they be ſtronger and overcome the in-bred ſpirits, ſo the in-bred ſpirits do yield and give place to the ſtrange tinctures and impurities, being deſtitute of the favour and cheriſhing of their places they err, becauſe they are unknown gueſts and ſind not place in their Inn.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the properties of the Elements or Sulphurs, (that is) of the nature of the mechanical ſpirits of the ſuperiour Firmament of the ſpirits of the Heart and Brain that they cannot ſuffer or abide any ſtrange or diſagreeable thing in their places, but expel all by their united forces and vertue. But if ſo be the tinctures of impurity find a firm Union with the mechanical ſpirits of the Ventricle, and the mixtion ceaſe in a fruitful Tranſplantation, and the governing of the in bred Balm ceaſe, and the proper Functions be neglected, they bring forth and cauſe continually the diſeaſed fruits of Tranſplantation, neither can ſuch affections be expelled by any induſtry either of Nature or in-bred Balm, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by the means and Miniſtery of art external Balm helps the internal, for the ſpirits of Tranſplantations are more ſtrong workers than the in-bred.</p>

But there be many Meats taken which while they nouriſh they receive the place of drink, ſo there be drinks which while they quench thirſt are in the place or ſtead of meats; from theſe one Generation of Tartar riſes, not two kinds, though from the commixtion of meat and drink Generation be cauſed, yet from that commixtion only one kind ariſes, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is ſeparated and divided into his kinds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and keeps the Nature of a Tartar, either of that which is commonly begot by meat, or that which is begot by drink.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Tartar of meat, this is to be noted, that every excrement of the Ventricle paſſes through the Inteſtines, in which paſſage it ſtays ſomewhat longer, and alſo that Tartar which in the good ſeparation is mixt with impure and ſtinking Sulphur, makes a conſtant uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ever adheres with the ſpirits of the Inteſtines, and then it produces infinite diſeaſes, almoſt all the kinds of the Cholick, the pains of the ſuperiour and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Ventricle, the obſtructions of the Belly, and the diſſolved diſeaſes, as Dyarrhaea, Dyſenteria, and Lienteria. And theſe of the Tartar of meat; for the more full un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of it read the 15. Chap. We will handle now of the Tartar of Drink.</p>

                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:30788:62"/>Urine is firſt ſeparated from nutriment, without the limits or place of the Ventricle, which is thus to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; the Liver attracteth nutriment, and in that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction Urine is ſeparated from nutriment in the Meſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raical veins; when as yet it paſſeth crude through thoſe paſſages it obſtructeth the Meſaraical veins and pores and other paſſages through which it paſſes; from whence many obſtructions and prickings ariſe, which are aſcribed to the bloud but falſly. Oftentimes it comes to paſs that for the abundance and reſerving of Tartar (the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaraical veins being obſtructed) nutriment cannot paſs unto the Liver, ſo that it comes to paſs that the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remains in the ſtomach, and then follow Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, loathing of Meats, the blaſting of the body by a Planet, being a kind of the Phthiſis, the paroxiſm of the ſtone which comes by cold and heat, as in the Plague, Pleuriſis, and ſuch like diſeaſes; from hence the Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipellas for the moſt part hath his original. The ſame is the Generation of the Tartar from Urine in the Liver, for Urine is nothing but a reſolved Salt, ſo that the Liver is made the fountain of many diſeaſes, which is a noble and excellent member, yea almoſt ſerving all the parts of the body, ſo that if it ſuffer any thing, all the members have a compaſſion, and alſo ſuffer and are brought into conſent; hereupon is the Dropſie, the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the Eryſipellas.

                     <p>THe Tartar is begot in the more principal Members, not of the Tartar of Urine, or of the excrement of the Ventricle, but from accidental and ſtrange excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which breeds in that place; though it ariſe from meat, yet is it not begot of excrements. All the parts and members of the body ſtand in need of continual nouriſhment and conſerving, for every part of the body properly hath a Ventricle which ſeparates the impure and ſuperadded tinctures from nutriment. The Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle properly ſo called or Oeconomical Ventricle of the whole body ſeparates the impure from the pure, and communicates aliment to the whole body, and all his parts. That general ſeparation of the Ventricle doth nor ſuſfice the parts to be nouriſhed, but there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſeparation, ſo that every Ventricle of every part may perfect the nutriment more, and ſeparate it more
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:30788:63"/>
exquiſitely. That impurity which is ſeparated is alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement, and hath divers emunctory places, as the Lungs by ſpittle, the Brain by the noſtrils, the Spleen by the Veins, or by the Ventricle properly ſo called, the Reins caſt forth excrement by Urine, the Heart by breathing forth of that maſs and fuliginous or miſty matter. From this excrement of the principal members a Tartar is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, and as the excrements of the principal members are moſt ſubtile, ſo alſo the Tartar is moſt ſubtile, and in all things is like aſwell to the nutriment as the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the body of Tartar which is carryed with the nutriment unto the principal members is volatile, and hath a vaporous ſubſtance. And this is to be noted of us, that the mechanical ſpirits of the members do differ much amongſt themſelves. As the mechanical ſpirits of the members differ much amongſt themſelves, the mechanical ſpirits of the Liver differ from the mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical ſpirits of the Ventricle, the mechanical ſpirit of the Heart or Brain differs much from the mechanical ſpirit of the Liver in ſubtileneſs and power; further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, the volatile excrements of the members flie the mechanical ſpirits of the Ventricle and Liver, and are conveyed to more ſubtile and potent ſpirits, though the Tartar be little in the principal members; yet in power it is great.</p>

The office of the Lungs was to attract Air and Spirit, and to make convenient ſpirit for the arteries, and to communicate it unto them for nouriſhment; when as the Tartar ſticks in the pipes, the Lungs are hindered, whereby they are leſs able to undergo their Functions as they ſhould, from hence many Diſeaſes are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as the Aſthma, the Cough, the impediment of Breathing or difficulty of Breathing, the Hectick Fever, and the Phthiſis, and other Diſeaſes, from which Tartar all the Diſeaſes of the Lungs are generated.</p>

                     <p>THere are Ventricles in the Bloud, Fleſh and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and all the parts of the body which are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed; where there is a Ventricle, there is a fire of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion and a ſeparation of pure from impure; where there is a ſeparation of impureneſs from the pure ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, there is alſo excrement; and where there is excrement, there is alſo Tartar either alone or elſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt with other excrements; for through the whole anatomy of the body, and in all the parts of it excrement is two wayes conſidered, it is either Sulphur or it is Salt, for in every aliment three things are be conſidered, Mercury which is nutriment, Sulphur which is avoided and expelled through the Belly, and Salt which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by Urine.</p>
                     <p>As thoſe excrements firſt in the Ventricle are coporal, ſo the excrements of the other parts are volatile and ſpiritual; for after the ſeparation of the Ventricle, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and volatile excrements coagulate in all the parts of the body.</p>
                     <p>It is an eſtabliſhed and confirmed ſentence of all Philoſophers, that the nature of bodies and ſpirits is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal, that bodies are reſolved into ſpirits, and ſpirits are tranſmutated into bodies; furthermore, Fleſh, Bloud, and Marrow have their Ventricle, and Digeſtion, Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Excrement and Tartar. Nature expells the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement of bloud by ſweat, it expells the excrements of the Fleſh by Urine, from whence the Urine of Bloud is, as <hi>Paracelſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The drineſs of the bones conſumes the excrement of Marrow, whatſoever remaineth comes and is conveyed unto the ligaments and concavities of the bones.</p>
                     <p>The nutriments of Bloud, Fleſh, and Marrow are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſpiritual and inviſible, but the excrements are viſible, and yet they are the moſt ſubtile of all the parts in the body.</p>
                     <p>In the attraction of nutriment of Bloud, the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Tartar was alſo ſpiritual and inviſible, as in the diſtilled and circulated ſpirit of Wine, but yet it ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates both the volatile and ſpiritual excrement in that they are excrements, whether Sulphur or Salt, by a moſt exquiſite digeſtion of the bloud; therefore the Tartar of the bloud is ſubtile, but it is coagulated by the ſpirit of Salt, and is reſolved and reduced by the ſame.</p>
                     <p>There is a twofold Tartar of the bloud, fleſh and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, either coagulated or reſolved. The Tartar is begot of the Element of Water whether it be from meat and drink, and therefore obnoxious to coagulation and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, when the excrement of Tartar is not expelled forth of the veins, it becometh like to a corn of ſand, or like to the grain Rice; ſo alſo without the veins and pores ſuch like grains of Tartar are begot though they encline more to reſolution, notwithſtanding if they remain lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:30788:65"/>
under the power of the ſpirit of Salt, they increaſe into a corporeal coagulation. The filth or flegm of bloud is the excrement of it, if that filth be more craſs and be not evacuated by ſweat, the Tartar makes an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with it or the Sulphur, and when this is come to paſs the Tartar is no more generated, but dung and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which Tartar lieth hidden; from hence mixt diſeaſes are ingendred: for the excrement of Nature, namely Sulphur, putrefies, from whoſe putrefaction ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the continual rotten Fever and other inflammations. This is to be noted, that the excrement of bloud, <hi>viz.</hi> Sulphur, being commixt with Tartar is expelled by ſweat, but if for the weakneſs and debility of the ſpirits or Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of bloud only the Sulphur be expelled, but the Salt or Tartar which is the other kind of excrement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, whether reſolved or coagulated, and brings infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſeaſes with it. The bloud in the greater World is nothing elſe but Wood, but there are infinite kinds of Wood, therefore there are infinite kinds of bloud, and as there are divers fruits of Trees, ſo divers diſeaſes of bloud exiſt, as he ſpeaks in <hi>Paragra. de Philoſophia,</hi> pag. 27. In another place he ſaith that the bloud is the Element of Water in the Microcoſm. How many fruits of the Element of Water are found to be in the Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſm, ſo many diſeaſes are found to be in the bloud of the Microcoſm.</p>

                     <p>WE inſiſting in the ſteps of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> hitherto have explained the three Beings of Diſeaſes, the Being of Stars, the Being of Nature, and the Being of Poiſon; though <hi>Paracelſus</hi> makes five Beings of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, yet ſeeing three only have natural cauſes, and admit explication, the other two, (namely, 1. the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal being which is oppoſed directly againſt a Chriſtian man, 2. and the real being which is an unſearchable ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret) are left unexplained of us, ſeeing that theſe three being explained ſuffice any Phyſician.</p>
                     <p>Perchance ſome may wonder wherefore we have not made mention in the general explication of Diſeaſes, of the three principles to the which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> aſcribes all the cauſes of diſeaſes. I anſwer, that <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in his book 1. and 2. <hi>Param.</hi> writes that all diſeaſes conſiſt in three beginnings, in Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, but it is not ſimply to be underſtood; but in his 1. book <hi>de origine Morb. ex tribus ſubſtantiis</hi> in the end of the 2. Chap. he expreſſes his mind, ſaying, that every diſeaſe is to be conferred with man through all his parts, &amp; he proceeds, that this is the ground of the knowledge of diſeaſes, if a diſeaſe muſt be conferred with man according unto his accident or proper and eſſential adjuncts, for ſo the four Elements, the three Principles, or three Subſtances, the four Stars, four Earths, four Waters, four Airs, four Fires, and all the conditions and properties of man are comprehended, without which no diſeaſe can be. In the greater World we ſee the ſublimation of Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in which there are three beginnings eſſentially, for an individual by it ſelf is abſolute. In the leſs World ſuch a digeſtion is wont to be made from too much Fire of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:30788:67"/>
digeſtion. This ſublimed Mercury is the greateſt poiſon in the Microcoſm, begets the Epilepſie or Falling ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But none will perſwade himſelf that this Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alone is a beginning, but an individual, in which not one but three beginnings concur. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> oftentimes calls it Mercurial Salt of Vitriol, in which he comprehends all thoſe which we have brought; ſometimes he calls it the Epilepſie which is from ſublimed Mercury. He ſpeaks truly &amp; Philoſophically, not as of a beginning, but as of an individual, in which Mercury notwithſtanding predominates. So it is called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>But that we may proceed to the being of Seed, we muſt call in mind that there are impurities and tinctures ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to every kind and worldly root which endeavour death and diſſolution, and for this cauſe all things are obnoxious to death and corruption. Again, that there are impurities and tinctures ſuperadded to the individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and beginnings which are uſual unto mankind for luſt and intemperance, of which we ſet down the being of Seed, for in them oftentimes the roots of the principles are ſo polluted, that by propagation the impreſſions of impurities are conſerved unto the third or fourth Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which impreſſions of impurities we call hereditary diſeaſes in Generations; for diſeaſes are brought unto man after a threefold manner, either 1. <note n="a" place="margin">And theſe Diſeaſes are called accidentary and acquiſitiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Roots therefore being ſpent and conſumed, thoſe which have not the Gout are begot of thoſe which have the Gout, and thoſe which have not the Epilepſie are

                     <p>Concerning that we ſaid that the diſeaſes from the being of ſeed of the Parents contain in them the four courſes of the Elements, Planets, Humours and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, theſe four courſes are but one courſe, for in every diſeaſe theſe four concur. Firſt, all diſeaſes are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentated and have their beginnings. Secondly, all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes are from the Planets by reaſon of their places, for all diſeaſes whether they riſe by the hurt of the aliments or hurt of the external impreſſions, or being of the ſeed of the Parents, either are Solar, Lunar, Saturnine, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, Venerial, Mercurial or Jovial.

Though there are four of theſe Stars and ſome diverſity of Generation, yea the greateſt difference

of the fruits may be beholden in the Elements, yet if we examine the matter more deeply, we ſhall find the unity of the Stars and the golden Chain of <hi>Homer</hi> of the whole World, for the inferiour bodies are as the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our are, and the ſuperiour are as the inferiour are, <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt bearing witneſs; becauſe the Heaven conſpires with the Earth, and the Earth with the Heaven in all things, who will deny the unity of Nature, and the Society of the inviſible Nature with the viſible? wherefore we profeſs that all the Stars of the Elements are only one Star which have been united from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in the fountain of unity; concerning that they produce divers effects in divers places, we do not aſcribe it to the diverſity of the ſtars, but to their Sciences, Gifts and interiour Signatures.</p>
                  <p>In the general explication of diſeaſes we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned three kinds of Beings of Diſeaſes; The Being of Stars, the Being of Nature, and the Being of Poiſon; but wherefore are there theſe three Beings? for there is but one only ſtar of Tranſplantation, and there is only one Nature which ſuffereth, yet not Nature it ſelf but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle and container of it; whether do more affect than are affected? not ſo, but as in the Macrocoſm there is a great difference of the Generation and the Tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of fruits to be obſerved, ſo alſo in the Microcoſm the Generation and Tranſplantation of diſeaſes is to be obſerved, for there is the ſame reaſon, concordance, conſpiration and unity of the ſtars of Tranſplantation and Generation.

and all things diſagree with a deadly hatred; from whence it comes to paſs that like things are cured by like things, and contraries are Remedies for contraries; becauſe things which agree do communicate their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and help, ſo likewiſe contraries expel their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; which things being ſo, and the unity of ſtars in the World being celebrated, it makes one cure of all diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, being divided into kinds, Aſtral or Spiritual, Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or Corporal. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in his book <hi>de morb. ament.</hi> ſaith, that in Aſtral or Spiritual diſeaſes, Aſtral and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Remedies are required; for whatſoever are required for a cure are contained in the power of the ſpirits.<note place="margin">The ſtar of Tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes.

                  <p>All the affections of the Head which uſe hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, are partly ſymptoms, partly diſeaſes; we divide theſe affections into three Orders in regard of the affected place or ſeat. Some affections poſſeſſe the Membranes of the Head, ſome the Subſtance of the Brain, ſome the Paſſages, ſome poſſeſſe the Pipes thereof. The Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Head are the thin film enwrapping the Brain and the Pericrany, in which pains are cauſed, for that they have exquiſite ſenſe. The dolours of the Head are twofold in reſpect of their efficient cauſes, for the dolour or pain is either cauſed from external cauſes or internal cauſes.</p>
                  <p>The pain of the Head from external cauſes, as too much labour, or heat of the Sun, or from the cold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperature of the Heaven, or from Gluttoning, Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, grievous Smells, and ſmiting of the Head. The pain which riſes from theſe cauſes is a weak and fainting pain, without a fixt and vital impreſſion.</p>
                  <p>The pain of the Head riſing from internal cauſes, or from fixt and vital impreſſion proceeds either from bloud, or reſolution, or obſtruction. <hi>Parcel.</hi> in his 10. book <hi>Parag. de capitis adverſitatibus internis.</hi> The bloud produces the pain of the Head by accidental dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion (that is) by the bubling ſorth of the ſpirits, or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:30788:70"/>
of the firſt three cauſes. In this pain cauſed from bloud let the Head vein be cut and the pain ceaſeth, and a true cure is made thereof; but if the condition of the ſick cannot abide the cutting of the vein, adminiſter unto him Narcotical moiſtures, of which kind are the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of Corals, Roſe, the ever-living Root of the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhade, Margarites and ſuch like, and they are given too within eſſentially, or elſe applied outwardly in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Plaiſter.</p>
                  <p>The reſolution of the vapours or Tartareous ſpirits beget the pain of the Head, namely, when the mouth of it is not ſhut by reaſon of the weakneſs of the Ventricle, and then the vapours aſcend, or the ſpirits of the Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Salt ſmite unto the Membranes and the Brain, from hence is the pain, as alſo the doloriferous fluxions and diſtillations.</p>
                  <p>In the cure of this diſeaſe the cauſe is firſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the Tartar being reſolved in the Ventricle is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, expelled and conſumed by oil or ſpirit of Vitriol, which is ſweet like to a ſmell, and hath a ſweet ſowre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, alſo the ſowr ſpirit of Sulphur. The opilation or obſtruction of the more principal bowels cauſes the Head-ach. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in his ſecond book Tract. 3. <hi>de Tartaro fol.</hi> 330. when there is not digeſtion made in the Reins, and the attractive vertue hath not which it may attract, then the Reins generate nutriment from the Liver; but if the Liver be obſtructed, the Reins attract nutriment through the Back-bone from the Head; and firſt pains are cauſed in the hinder part of the Head, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the Hemicrany, ſometime it poſſeſſes the whole Head; therefore in the Hemicrany and every pain of the Head the only cure is, that the Reins be firſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that the obſtruction of the Liver be taken away that the Reins may have nutriment, which is not only to be underſtood of the Reins, but of other principal

Members. Here the ſowr water of Mercury bears ſway, and the ſpirits of Vitriol and the ſpirits of Tartar.

                  <p>The Mania is of us called a furor or Out-raging mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which immitateth the doting of the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick neither in thought, word, or deed, but yet with brawling, chiding, and ſhouting, as likewiſe the man poſſeſt with it is of a terrible look.

                     </gap>ils, and hands. The ſigns and proper adjuncts of thoſe which are Out-raging are demonſtrated by experience. The cauſe in which all the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> inſiſt and agree of ſhall be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by <hi>Paracelſus</hi> whether it be true or falſe. The Mania according unto <hi>Paracelſus</hi> is twofold. The one
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:30788:74"/>
which invadeth a ſound man, and it is a diſeaſe, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a ſymptom of a diſeaſe, as in the Plague and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in his book <hi>de morbis amentum</hi> writes in the ſecond Chap. that the Mania riſes from three principles or beginnings, and in the ſame Chap. he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the Mania into two kinds. The one is that which riſes from pain, when as a vapour remains in the Head, the other riſeth from ſublimation, and is coagulated in the Head. In the Cure we muſt reſpect theſe two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>viz.</hi> that the vapours from pain be conſumed and diſſipated, and that that be reſolved and reduced which is coagulated of ſublimation.</p>
                  <p>The Mania hath his original either from Bloud, Veins, Ventricle, Inteſtines, Reins, Liver, Spirit of Urine, and the Lungs, <hi>de morb. amentium, cap.</hi> 2. It cannot be ſufficiently known where the mine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant cauſe of the Mania is, for it is an aſtral diſeaſe. The true cauſe of Mania is in what part of the body ſoever Mercury lyeth hid, and is reverberated into ſlime, and is diſſolved in very ſtrong water, which being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved is mixt with the ſpirit of life and inflames it: there is ſuch a ſubtileneſs in this ſtrong water, that it will not bide in the bottom but riſes up unto the top. The extreme acrimony of that humour appears from ſneeſing, which provoking quality riſes from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt acretion, which comes to paſs if any receive in at his Noſtrils the ſmell of the ſpirits of Aqua fortis, Salt, and Vitriol. This reverberation of Mercury proceeds from too much heat, as for example. If the ſpirit of Salt be mixt with the ſpirit of life it is of ſuch a ſubtilty and power, that as ſoon as it comes to the Brain it cauſes the Mania and extreme madneſs.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of the Mania is twofold, the one which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerates and coagulates the faulting matter; The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which altogether diſperſes and conſumes the matter
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:30788:74"/>
of which it is generated. The refrigeration and coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the matter faulting is cauſed by the curing of the Falling-ſickneſs. Receive of the oil of Camphora <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. of the oil of Musk <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. mix them, and adminiſter them at every time.</p>
                  <p>This medicine is moſt excellent in the cure of the Mania, for it doth wonderfully coagulace the matter of the Mania, and it extinguiſheth the heat of the body and the boiling of the bloud, and it altereth the matter, as cold changes Water into Air.

The cure of melancholy; the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> (which ſay that melancholy is the cauſe of the diſeaſe of ſadneſs, when as it is only the name of a diſeaſe) they endeavour to cure this diſeaſe by contraries.

The decree and opinion of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi> will ever be firm and conſtant, that melancholy or heavineſs cannot be removed by the decoctions of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries.</p>
                  <p>In the curing of melancholy the ſpecifical vertues of the ſecrets are to be conſidered. The ſpecifical vertue which expels melancholy is in the flowrs of Antimony, for by the flowrs of Antimony thoſe are freed wich have been bound in chains for ſome moneths. The flowrs of Antimony are adminiſtred in a little quantity of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riaca in the morning twice, or thrice, or four times, by reaſon of the contumacy of the diſeaſe.

                  <p>The Cure of the Lethargy. It is to be removed, and Nature is to be corroborated and ſtrengthned. <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in Parag. de Alchymia</hi> ſaith, that the lethargy is not to be cured by ordinary decoctions, for it is a Mineral diſeaſe, and therefore it is to be cured by Minerals. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus</hi> in his cures relates that a certain man after a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fell into a deep ſleep, ſo that he felt not if any prickt him, neither would he open his eyes or ſpeak any thing, he had the lethargy, and I cured it with the oil of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol; ſo alſo there was a woman waking which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the lethargies ſleep, ſo that her eyes were ſtill ſhut, and hardly would open them if ſhe were called upon, neither could any underſtand what ſhe ſpake, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did ſhe rightly anſwer.

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Falling-ſickneſs and his kinds.</head>
                  <p>THe Falling-ſickneſs is a diſeaſe inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the body, not corporally, but an<note place="margin">The Epilepſie or Falling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſickneſs is a preternatural affect of the Head, by which the whole body for a certain time is convulſt with the hurt of ſenſe and reaſon.</note> aſtral diſeaſe. It is an Elementary diſeaſe, not a complexionate diſeaſe, it is a ſpiritual diſeaſe, not a natural diſeaſe. The ſpecies or kinds of the Falling-ſickneſs are all the kinds of the Epilepſie, the ſuffocation of the matrix without his place, the ſwounding with his kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> the returning <hi>deliquium</hi> and the ſwounding not returning, the <hi>Vertigo</hi> or turning of the<note place="margin">The Vertigo is a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affect of the Head whereby all things ſeem to turn about.</note> head. The <hi>Vertigo</hi> riſes from the obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the principal bowels. <hi>Paracelſus lib. 3. de caducis para.</hi> 2. The <hi>Vertigo</hi> is a kind of the Falling-ſickneſs. The cure of the <hi>Vertigo</hi> is the ſame with the Falling-ſickneſs. The cauſe of dizzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the ſpirit of Sulphur aſcending from the inferiour Heaven unto the Firmament (that is) unto the Head in which it is reſolved, it being reſolved produces the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigo,</hi> the Pulſe of the heart, and the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare<note place="margin">Sublimed Mercuty cauſes the paroxiſin of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plectick and the Epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick by his fame.

Therefore we muſt know that the moſt of the Mercurial diſeaſes are kinds of Mercury, and as many kinds as there are of Mercury, ſo many kinds there are of a diſeaſe; for the Falling-ſicknes is not cauſed from Complexions, Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,<note place="margin">

This man amongſt all the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> of this age came the nigheſt to the knowledge of the cauſe of the Epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. In another place <hi>Paracelſus</hi> writes that the matter of the Falling-ſickneſs is ſtupefactive and biting Sulphur, exiſting in the Microcoſm, which (like unto ſmoke) by boyling cauſed from the ſtars, hurts the brain.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Paracel. de morbis amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, tract. 1. cap.</hi> 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The original of the Falling-ſickneſs is fivefold in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their places forth of which it firſt proceeds and ariſes, from the brain, heart, liver, inteſtines, or from the four external members. <hi>Fernelius</hi> makes three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of the Epilepſie, one is aſſigned from the Brain, another is of the Ventricle, the 3. is that which is cauſed by the conſent of every other part. <hi>Galen</hi> brought in a twofold Epilepſie, by it ſelf, and by conſent. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is one and the ſame diſeaſe proceeding from the ſame Beginning, Root, and Seed. They cauſe the nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and conſervants, and the difference of the ſick; they alter the ſignatures of the ſymptoms by their vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, celerity, frequencie, duration, and ſuch like; for the Falling-ſickneſs of the Inteſtines, Diaphragma, Teeth, Hands, Feet, Teſticles, Marrow, and Throat do differ much amongſt themſelves.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, that the Falling-ſickneſs of the glew and bloud differ much from that of the Ventricle and Diaphragma by reaſon of their places and matrices, in which the cauſe of the diſeaſe conſiſts, and where it emulates the nature, properties, ſubtilty, and power of the matrix. Again,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:30788:79"/>
according unto <hi>Paracelſus de caducis Parag. 3. fol.</hi> 339. 340. The Falling-ſickneſs is fourfold according unto the four Elements, for the differences of the fourfold Fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſickneſs are taken from the diverſity of the pains and fits. We muſt here recur unto the beginnings of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.</p>
                  <p>As in the Macrocoſm the Element of Fire is moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, ſo in the Microcoſm the fit of the Falling-ſickneſs from the fiery ſtar is moſt vehement, for it conſiſts of more forcible and potent ſeeds, by whoſereſolution it is wont to poſſeſs the vital Elements of the whole body in a moment like a thunderbolt. The paroxiſm of the Fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſickneſs from the Air is moſt mild and gentle; ſo alſo there are four degrees of the Falling-ſickneſs in the Microcoſm, as in the Philoſophy of the Macrocoſm we have ſet down four degrees of the Elements. The Fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſickneſs from the ſtar of the Earth obtains the firſt degree. The Falling-ſickneſs from the ſtar of the Air obtains the ſecond degree. The Falling-ſickneſs from the ſtar of Water obtains the third degree. The Falling ſickneſs from the ſtar of Fire obtains the fourth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
                  <p>After this manner the ſpecifical Remedies of the Falling-ſickneſs are divided into four degrees, as we will ſay in our cure and his kinds.</p>
                  <p>The Falling-ſickneſs and ſuch like diſeaſes which are infamous and notable in deſtruction and difference of paroxiſms or ſymptoms have twofold particular indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for ſome Remedies eſpecially reſpect the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxiſms, ſome reſpect the roots or grounds thereof; the cooling of the boiling ſpirits, girding, pricking, and binding, &amp;c. eſpecially reſpect the paroxiſms, but the reſolution of the Epilepſies tincture (that is) the conſumption and aboliſhing of the ſeed of the root re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the roots themſelves, &amp;c. Theſe indications ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:30788:80"/>
eaſie mixtions and may be abſolved by the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. Therefore we have diſtributed the remedies or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments into two orders. I he one reſpect the paroxiſm, the other reſpect the roots or grounds thereof. Laſtly, we adjoyn medicaments which do not only reſpect the paroxiſm of the Epilepſie, but alſo the very roots.</p>
                  <p>The true <hi>opiate Laudanum</hi> of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> reſpects the paroxiſm, and conſtringes, mitigates, releaſes, and binds the boiling ſpirits, of which iij or more grains are admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred with the ſpirits of Vitriol and eſſence of Camphora. The eſſence of Manna and mans bloud reſpects the root it ſelf, of which there is to be adminiſtred in the full moon unto the Epileptick every moneth, for it mitigates it and expels it. A perpetual remedy of it is the eſſence of mans ſcull with the water of the flowr of Linden in the paroxiſm, and before the paroxiſm a ſpoonful of Selondines water for the firſt doſis. The extract of Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terium. The Azure ſtone, and the Armenian ſtone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the water of Balmmint and Bugloſs. The eſſence of black Ellebor. <hi>Theophraſt.</hi> ſaith, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this diſeaſe if any have 3. 4. 5. or 6. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxiſms and no more, two drops of the oil of Vitriol, two drops of the oil of Pearls adminiſtred in <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> do altogether remove and expel this diſeaſe. <hi>Theophraſt.</hi> ſaith, that he hath approved this by deed. The Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſtone, and the Mercury of Gold or Silver removes this diſeaſe. <hi>Paracel. in tinctura Phyſicorum,</hi> ſaith, that the oil of Silver (of which there muſt be taken ij. or iiij. drops with the water of Betony and Sage and Balmmint) diſſolves, conſumes, and removes the root of the Fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſickneſs. The Smaragdus not only drunk, but if it be hanged about the neck, it wars and expels the Fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſickneſs as an enemy. Read <hi>Theophraſt. lib. 3. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag.</hi> ſo alſo in his book <hi>de ſignis Zodiaci,</hi> a little after his
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:30788:80"/>
Preface he ſaith, that in the centre of the Scull of a<note place="margin">A <hi>German</hi> cured his Son with ſuch a bone of the Fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> ſtrangled man there is a bone found of a triangular fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, it is not found in all Sculs but in ſome. This bone being pulverized and adminiſtred in the appropriated water, removes and takes away the Falling-ſickneſs though man hath been troubled with it for twenty years.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Galeniſts</hi> adminiſter Atomatical medicines, and Muſcatum, Diacaſtorium, Diamoſchatum Dulce, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleriſarcaticon, Hieralogodion, and Oleum Benedictum. <hi>Phriſius in speculo medicinali,</hi> and <hi>Ruffus in Autidotario</hi> commends ſyrup of Stecados. <hi>Phriſius in speculo, fol.</hi> 67. adminiſters <hi>Magna Therica,</hi> and Sage, <hi>pillulae faetidae.</hi> The <hi>Galeniſts</hi> ſay that conſerves or conduits and alſo Trochiſſes, and Eclegmata reſpect and cure the head and other cold diſtemperatures of the ſinews of the head; ſo alſo the flowrs of Roſemary and of Galingale and of Marigold, with Betony and Briony, adminiſtred in the morning and evening of the quantity of a Walnut. Sometime Aromatical powders are mixt with Sugar or appropriated ſyrup, which mixture they call a confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But certainly it is well ſaid of ſome of more ſincere Philoſophy, that the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> flatter and palliate the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, but they do not cure them, which the experience of the cure of the Falling-ſickneſs doth teſtifie; for if crude and imperfect medicaments effect nothing in the curing of the Falling-ſickneſs, then the ſick are neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of thoſe falſe Phyſicians as if they were incurable; for the cure of the Falling-ſickneſs is not in Sage, Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gold, and Marjorum. It is no wonder that they believe not the original of the Falling-ſickneſs when as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee it with their ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>The Remedies of the Falling-ſickneſs are twofold, Coporal and Spiritual; ſome are good for the younger ſort only, ſome for old men, ſome for maids, ſome for old Women, ſome cure by coldneſs (not by that external

quality, but by the Narcotical and coagulative virtue,) ſome cure by their ſpecifical vertue, ſome by their ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power and vertue. The oil of Amber is good for Infants and the younger ſort, one drop of it being admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred in the water of Fennel unto the Infants; ſo alſo the water of Selondine is moſt excellent for the younger ſort, and Infants, being anointed upon their noſtrils, as the oil of Amber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Let three drops of the oil of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber be adminiſtred in the liquor of the water of the Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Vallies unto the younger which are about 18. or 19. years of age.

                  <p>The Apoplexy is when as this glewiſh moiſture for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh<note place="margin">The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy is a preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affect of the head, whereby the whole body is ſuddenly deprived of ſenſe and motion with the hinderance of breathing.</note> a principal member.</p>
                  <p>The Paralyſis is when it forſaketh the leſs principal member, as ſinews, muſcles, eyes, ears, hands, arms, ſides, and feet.</p>
                  <p>The glew of the body is a nutriment of his member,<note place="margin">What the glew is.</note> and a conſervation of the retentive and motive vertue from the faculties of the digeſtive vertue. This glew hath an attractive, retentive, and motive vertue; for example, whatſoever the Reins attract, the glew at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth

(that is) the inferiour heaven, the root and very eſſence of life, called of <hi>Fernelius</hi> the implanted ſpirits, for the body and ſubſtance of the reins attract nothing; thoſe which follow are included in a Parentheſis; for it is ſaid in Philoſophy, that the actions do not proceed from the parts and bodies, but from the faculties inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the parts; when the glew is ſeparated from ſome part, then preſently it cauſes an inſenſibleneſs and a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of motion, from whence there riſes either an Apoplexy or Paralyſis, for in the glew there is a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and motive faculty, and not in the members. The kinds of diſeaſes from the defect of it are the Apoplexy, and the Paralyſis of the tongue and the members, &amp;c. The lethargy and the torture of the mouth. <hi>Paracelſus de peſt. tract. 3. cap.</hi> 1. ſaith, that the <hi>gutta</hi> is begot of Martial poiſon; ſo likewiſe <hi>de gutta part 4. fol.</hi> 154. ſaith, that the <hi>gutta</hi>

In the ſame Treatiſe he ſaith, that plegm is only an excrement of the brain, but the Apoplexy is not an excrement but a moſt ſubtile thing from the ſtars of the Firmament; ſo in the ſame place, <hi>fol.</hi> 148. The <hi>gutta</hi> in the Microcoſm is a lightning in the Macrocoſm, for as the lightning melteth Iron, the ſubſtance or body of the Iron yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, ſo the <hi>gutta</hi> melteth the brain (not corporally but ſpiritually, for it depriveth it of all ſenſe and motion) and alſo the heart and lungs, as when wax is melted by fire, and compact into a maſs, the parts remaining whole. It ſmiteth from the crown of the head the exteriour members, hands and feer, and it burneth and conſumeth the ſenſitive and motive faculty thereof; ſo when it ſmites the tongue, there follows a privation of ſpeech, yet the ſubſtance of the tongue remains, but not the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence thereof; for the eſſence thereof is a ſpiritual Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſis,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:30788:83"/>
which manifeſtly demonſtrates the ſpiritual and aſtral eſſence of the diſeaſe whiles that the ſpirits do work againſt the ſpirits; when the lightning of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſm ſmites the Lungs there follows a ſuffocation. The Lungs do not want an attractive, ſenſitive, and motive faculty; ſo man is ſuffocated of the ſmoak of the lightning which we more often ſee to<note place="margin">The lightning of Salt and Sulphur conſiſts of two contraries, it is accended from the water of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſm corporally, but from the water of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſm ſpiritually, for the heaven in the Microcoſm is ſpiritual.</note> be in the Macrocoſm; ſo when it ſmites the brain, it melts the brain, and deprives it of all ſenſe and motion, and then the danger of death is certain.

The Apoplexy<note place="margin">What the Apoplexy is properly.</note> ought not to be called an Apoplexy but from the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament of the medicine. Cachymical and ſublimated Mercury (as Auripigmentum) is the cauſe of it. But how can Mercury be the cauſe of the Apoplexy, when as <hi>Paracel.</hi> ſaith that it is a kind of <hi>gutta;</hi> but the cauſe of <hi>gutta</hi> is a lightning, the cauſe of the lightning is Sulphur and Salt as two contraries in the Academy of Nature by a favour and Patronizing of the community thereof. The Apoplexy riſes from ſeed, or one or four Elements, or from fire and water, and ſulphur, ſalt, and mercury; many things are here united which ſenſe cannot diſcern, as are the ſeminal roots of bodies called principles and elements in which all things are conſerved.</p>
                  <p>The ſign of the Apoplexy is froth, and a ſuffocation<note place="margin">Signs.</note> with a contraction. The ſigns of the Paralyſis are the<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Apoplexy and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſis.</note> alteration of a member and a ſtupefaction of a part. The difference of the Apoplexy and Paralyſis is this. The Apoplexy reſpects the principal members and whole body. The Paralyſis doth not hurt the principal mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but only the four exteriour members and leſs prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal parts, as hands and feet.</p>

                  <p>The cure of the Apoplexy is twofold, internal and<note place="margin">The Cure.</note> external. The internal cure is that which is made by ſtrengthning medicines; The external is perfected by balms.</p>

                  <p>The external cure is made by the balm of Bevers ſtones, and of the Marigold, of the Lillies of the Vallies, Serpentine, Elenum, and Amber. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in his cures writes that he reſtored one having the Paralyſis only by eſſence of Antimony: A myſtery in the Apoplexy is the ſolution of Pearls or oil of Pearls.

The internal affections,</note> and it procreates an ill off-ſpring, for all the affections of the eyes have their original from the flux, unleſs they be produced from ſome manifeſt cauſe. The affections of the eyes are twofold, interiour and exteriour. The interiour I call which are cauſed within the fleſhy membrane, and have their original from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſeats of the brain. I call the external thoſe which exiſt within or without the fleſhy membrane. Furthermore, of the internal affections which hurt this bowel, ſome exiſt in the diſcerning ſpirits, ſome in the brain, ſome in the optick ſpirits, ſome in the cryſtaline humour. The ſpirits that they may ſee quickly and diſtinctly, ought to be many and Ethereal, for if there be many ſpirits but yet craſs, they fee things far off and near, but not diſtinctly. This is almoſt the diſeaſe of old men.</p>
                  <p>Blindneſs, obſcurity, and every imbeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ſight (whoſe cauſe is not conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous<note place="margin">Blindneſs is a privation of ſight, cauſed by reaſon of the corruption of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick ſpirits.</note> in the eye) riſes from the hurt of the optick ſinew or cryſtaline humour. The hurt of the optick ſinew is obſtruction, which is from the influx of more craſs humour, or it is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption cauſed from the external or internal ſharp and corroſive humours.</p>
                  <p>The peculiar hurt of the Cryſtaline humour is a remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it out of his proper place, either by falling or ſmiting, by which the eye is vehemently ſmitten and hurt.

                  <p>The hurts of the pupil appear manifeſtly unto the<note place="margin">The hurts of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil.</note> ſenſe, and theſe are Dilatation, Imminution, Divulſion, and Ruption, Dilatation (whether it be cauſed at firſt or riſe afterward from ſome diſeaſe) hurts the ſight, ſo that it cauſes the ſpirits to be diffuſed, and dilated, and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated abroad. The native imminution (becauſe it gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, conſtringeth, and incraſſeth the ſpirits) makes the ſight moſt quick, but yet it is diſeaſed, becauſe it hath a preternatural cauſe which makes it worſe. The divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ruption neither occaecates, nor hurts the ſight greatly; furthermore, the humour cauſes a dilatation in the Grape like tunicle, which alſo being included and abounding, it diſtends and amplifies the little hole which is the pupil.

The miſt is a thin humour ſticking in the third tunicle, whereby one thinketh that he ſaw all things through a miſt, a vapour, or ſmoke; this humour waxing craſs begets at length a white ſpot in the eye, for the white is a craſs and white humour in the third tunicle, or elſe collected and condenſed above it; ſo that it darkneth and dulleth for the moſt part the quickneſs of ſeeing.

phraſtus lib. 12. parag. fol.</hi> 16. ſaith, that the pains of the teeth with their accidents are in the roots of the bone, &amp;c. <hi>f.</hi> 417. The firſt cauſe of the ach of the teeth is from the ſharpneſs of the Salt. Sometime the gumms<note place="margin">The ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and growing forth of the Gumms. <hi>Aphta</hi> are little puſhes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the lips.</note> ſwell above meaſure, that almoſt they cover the teeth, eſpecially in ſuch as have ſoft and ſpongious gumms, and ſuch as live in moiſt and watery places as ſhip-men do. The <hi>Aphta</hi> are Ulcers not very hollow inſinuating it ſelf into every part of the mouth, palat, gumms, and into the ſides of the tongue, and into the root of it. Theſe are very common to children, but in thoſe come to age hot vapours cauſe them riſing from the Liver; ſometime ſalt flegm doth cauſe them, which flows from the head; theſe are frequent in Fevers, ſometime they are without Fevers. There are grievous ones obſerved, of which kind are obſerved to be ſometime when womens flowrs are ſuppreſt.</p>
                  <p>The cure. Without controverſie it is that theſe bliſters are generated from impure bloud (that is) from Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial poiſon contained in the bloud; ſeeing that like are cured with like, and contraries with contraries, all the kinds of bliſters are altogether cured by the eſſence of Mercury. This eſſence of Mercury is not ſo manifeſt and perſpicuous in any metall as in Mercury, and it is not ſo excellent and vertuous in any mineral as in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, there is none more effective in any wood than in <hi>Ivory, Aſh, lignum ſanctum,</hi> and <hi>Juniper,</hi> there is none more effective in herbs than in the herb Serpents Tongue, Arſemart, and Serpentine.

                     <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of the hurts of the Lungs, their Symptoms, cauſes, and Signs.</head>
                  <p>BY the name of Lungs we underſtand all the veſſels which are in them and the rough artery. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which happen unto the Lungs are the <hi>peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia,</hi> obſtruction, the impoſthume, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>The obſtruction is frequent in the Lungs as in other more principal Members or Bowels. The cauſes of<note place="margin">The cauſes of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Lungs.</note> the obſtructions in the lungs are diverſe. The aboundance and clammineſs, and thickneſs of humours, the <hi>Grando,</hi> the Stone or liquid and coagulated tartar. The tartar is the cauſe of many obſtructions, all obſtructions are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by tartar. The affections which riſe from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the Lungs are the Cough, the Aſthma, the ſtrangling Rheum, and oftentimes the <hi>Phthiſis.</hi> The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of humours flowing into that only membrane (which compaſſeth the throat) with pain, and alſo ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it, obſcures the voice and brings hoarſneſs. The too much roughneſs of the throat or artery (whether it be cauſed from ſmoke, or crying, or cold) cauſes this hoarſneſs. But if the diſtillation fall into the hollow pipe of the throat, it cauſes a little cough with a certain ſtraitning of the provoking acrimony. But if it fall into the breaſt and Lungs it cauſes a great Cough, burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from the bottom of the breaſt. This comes to paſs when Nature endeavours to caſt forth any thing which is moleſtuous by his acrimony or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction<note place="margin">The Cough is a preterns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſounding motion of the Lungs accompanied with the violent blowing.</note> with a violent blowing and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of breath; even as when any thing falls into the throat while we eat or drink.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:30788:98"/>
But certainly if that which diſtils into the Lungs be very ſmall, then it is hardly caſt forth by coughing, but much more hard it is and difficult to cough forth that which is craſs and clammy in the Lungs, neither can it eaſily be wiped away or removed, or blown forth by breathing. When the diſtillation is little and light, then the ſymptoms which accompany it are light; but when much and grievous diſtillation comes ſuddenly upon one, then a certain ſtrangling difficulty of breathing vexes him, and he breaths often ſwiftly and very vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently. Furthermore, the craſs and clammy humour which poſſeſſes the Lungs and his artery troubles one<note place="margin">The dry Cough.</note> with a dry cough vehemently, by which any thing is ſcarcely extended; it cauſes the breathing to be difficult, and while one breaths it cauſes a ratling or noiſe in the<note place="margin">The cauſe of the noiſe in the throat while one breaths.

This craſs and clammy humour with the time thickneth and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more and more, notwithſtanding by the force of heat it comes to be a vitreous or ſlimy flegm or tartar of things. An aboundance of it being collected in the pipes of the Lungs produces the Aſthma,<note place="margin">The Aſthma is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of breathing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with a ſound, perceived either inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or outwardly in the breaſt.

                  <p>Here it is to be obſerved, that the Aſthma is not only begot from diſtillations, but from the proper tartar of the Lungs, which remains in the Lungs, ſeparation and expulſion being fruſtrated, as we have demonſtrated in our general explication of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <hi>Fernelius</hi> doth here agree with <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> for he ſaith, that the clammy humour in the Generation of the Aſthma doth coagulate into hail, and after into ſtones, with which we ſee ſometime the Lungs filled when as they be cut.</p>

The cure of the Conſumption contains in it the cure of many diſeaſes. In the true cure of the Conſumption (as well the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular as the univerſal) there is great regard to be had of all the principal members; namely, that their tartareous obſtructions, and that the oppilation of the ſpirit of life be removed, and then that help be brought unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed nature (that is) to the liquor of life or radical moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture or inferiour heaven, ſo that the inferiour heaven may be reſtored and renewed. The obſtruction of the members and oppilation of the ſpirit of life is removed by the ſpirit of Vitriol, as it is ſaid in the beginning. The heaven is reſtored and renewed by the myſtery of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and the magiſtery of Pearls. Theſe two indications, <hi>viz.</hi> the ablation or removal of obſtruction and renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heaven are contained in one root of Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for the eſſence of Antimony (or admirable flowr of nature) conſumes all the tartareous matter, and openeth all the obſtructions by a ſpecifical vertue; in the next place it begets a new heaven by conſuming the contrary by a fiery force, and by opening the obſtructions it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news all nature. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> calls this tranſmutation of nature which bears ſway in the tincture of Antimony, by the name of Tranſplantation or Philoſophical Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that truly, for it tranſmutates the bad conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the beſt temperature; and as before in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the <hi>Phthiſis</hi> there is made a Tranſplantation from good to evil, ſo here in the cure the temperature of the bad properties is tranſmutated into the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the beſt.

The obſtruction of the Lungs is twofold, one is of the veins from whence the Dropſie is, the other is of the ſubſtance from whence the <hi>phthiſis</hi> and inflammation are. The <hi>Galeniſts</hi> have left this difference unexplain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and have uſed one for the other. <hi>Theophraſt. lib. 1. de tartaro tract. 2. cap. 3. fol.</hi> 226. when the obſtruction is in the Liver, then man is diſcoriated and his colour is changed in a dayes ſpace, and from thence there ariſes a thirſt becauſe the Liver hath not moiſture by reaſon of the oppilation, and that the nutriments cannot paſs by the Liver they return and corrupt, &amp;c. That is, from the obſtruction of the Liver and Tongue there ariſes a drineſs. The tumours in the feet are begot from obſtruction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when the tartar doth lie ſo long it comes to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and nature works and expels it to ſome place in the legs; from hence are the tumours, &amp;c. and there is much Urine, becauſe the liquor of the Liver is diſſolved and the diſeaſe maturates, and the Liver gives it ſelf to be his own liquor, for the expulſive vertue attracts U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, therefore it takes that which it finds: ſo alſo if the

                  <p>In the general explication of diſeaſes it is ſaid, that every member hath his Ventricle, in which the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſeparated from the impure matter, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure is expelled by the emunctory places, which is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, of Sulphur and Salt; but if they be not expelled, but perſiſt in the Ventricle of every member, from thence there follows an obſtruction of the ſpirit of life, and from the obſtruction there riſes a corruption and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of a member. Firſt, tartar dominates; from tarrar alone the chronical diſeaſes are begot. Secondly, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur predominates; from tartar and Sulphur are begot acute and inflammatory diſeaſes; but if tartar alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main and Sulphur be expelled there enſues a <hi>phthiſis,</hi> pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and conſumption, not only of a member but of the whole body, by reaſon the heaven is deſtroyed; but if the Sulphur and Salt remain mixt, and Sulphur predominate, then they produce <hi>prunella, pleuriſies,</hi> and <hi>bub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The ſtone of the bladder is twofold, 1. is in uncoth parts (that is) that which depends of the excrement of meat and drink, which is conveyed from the ventricle to the reyns, and from thence to the bladder. The 2. is a tartar, which proceeds from the ſalt of urine of bloud, and it proceeds from the excrement of tartar or fleſh. The ſtone of the bladder is generated from the ſalt of urine by the Element of fire of the Microcoſm.

works by ſecond cauſes, and uſes them as his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and rod; For God when he puniſheth men exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes &amp; uſes anothers works and means. The Supernatural plague is from God, or elſe from Satan permiſſively. The ſupernatural plague is a puniſhment and ſcourge ſent of God, <hi>Exod. 9. Levit. 26. Deut. 28. 1 Chronic.</hi> 22. The ſupernatural plague permiſſively from Satan, is when God permits Sathan to puniſh men for ſin. This moſt tyrannous enemy both of God and man is ſorry that he cannot overthrow God and man, as <hi>Job</hi> witneſſeth in his hiſtory. Again the plague riſes from conjurers, <hi>Exod. 7, &amp;</hi> 8. of which Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Acts. 8. Matth.</hi> 7. The natural plague is twofold, one is generation from the impreſſion of the Stars; the other is from the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Microcoſm. The plague of impreſſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the firmament of Heaven, God puniſhing men by ſecond cauſes uſes the conjunction of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> or the Ecclipſes of malevolous Stars, as the father which puniſheth the ſon uſeth the rod. The beams of theſe ſtars (being of the nature of Arſenick, of Sulphur, Mars, Woolfs milk, Woolf bane and Hemlock) infect the ſpiritual and corporal nutriment. This is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the plague from the aſtral influence. But men infected with the Haemorrhoids and Plague infect the ſound onely with their look. But much more many are infected from the look of women which are affected with the <hi>menſtruum</hi> and Plague. Again the Plague may come by breath, heat, ſweat, ſmells, dwelling in ſome place, and by the clothes of the infected.</p>
                  <p>The Plague may riſe from Imagination. <hi>Paracelſ. de occulta Philoſophia,</hi> ſets down preſervatives in the time of the Plague. It is not diſconvenient to change the air.

The third pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative, the <hi>Zenecthon</hi> of <hi>Paracelſ.</hi> hang'd about the neck hinders the attractive virtue of the Microcoſm.

The fift preſervative; thoſe which are buſied about the infected let them hold Francincenſe in their mouths, and let the infected hold the roots of Juniper. The ſixt, the eſſence of the bloud of the Hart and ſtork are moſt excellent preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatives.
